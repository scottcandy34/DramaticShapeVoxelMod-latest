-- Driver: the A/B performance benchmark.
--
-- One scripted, deterministic session that exercises the three things the
-- mod is slow at, and writes the numbers to a JSON file so two runs can be
-- diffed:
--
--   1. LOADING IN      -- engaging the mode from flat: shader compiles,
--                         canvas allocations, the first map's mesh, its
--                         atlas bakes and its glass mask, all at once.
--   2. A NEW AREA      -- walking Pallet -> Route 1 -> Viridian with cold
--                         caches, then walking the SAME route again with
--                         them warm. The gap between the two is the
--                         complaint; closing it is the fix.
--   3. A LOW CAMERA    -- standing still at each pitch rung. The 75 degree
--                         rung puts the horizon in frame, which triples the
--                         sun frustum and hands the sky its disc to draw.
--
--   POKEPORT_DRIVER=mods/DramaticShapeVoxelMod/tests/voxel_bench.lua \
--   DS_PERF=1 BENCH_TAG=baseline lovec.exe .
--
-- knobs (env):
--   DS_PERF     must be set, or lib/Perf.lua stays dark and measures nothing
--   BENCH_TAG   output name, ds_bench/<tag>.json     (default "run")
--   BENCH_HOLD  frames to walk per leg              (default 900)
--
-- THREE THINGS THIS RUN CONTROLS FOR, because a benchmark that does not is
-- measuring the weather:
--
--   * VSYNC OFF. With it on every frame costs exactly one refresh interval
--     and the whole exercise reads as 16.7ms flat, saving or no saving.
--   * THE CLOCK PINNED to day. The day/night cycle changes the sky, the sun
--     angle, the shadow frustum and whether windows are lit -- so an
--     unpinned run compares two different scenes.
--   * ENCOUNTERS OFF. A wild battle mid-walk derails the route and charges
--     its frames to whichever map the script thought it was on. Stubbed on
--     the state class for this process only; nothing is written to disk.
