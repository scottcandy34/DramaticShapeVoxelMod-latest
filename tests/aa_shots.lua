-- Driver: one scene, once per rung of the AA row.
--
-- The AA row is the one setting in this mod whose whole effect is a pixel
-- wide, so it is also the one that cannot be judged from a description. This
-- renders the SAME frame at each rung and writes one PNG per rung; put two of
-- them side by side, magnified, and the row is either doing something or it
-- is not.
--
--   POKEPORT_DRIVER=mods/DramaticShapeVoxelMod/tests/aa_shots.lua \
--   SHOT_DIR=<dir> lovec.exe .
--
-- knobs (env):
--   SHOT_DIR   output directory (created if missing)  (default "shots/aa")
--   AA_MAP     map id                                 (default VIRIDIAN_CITY)
--   AA_SPOT    "x,y[,facing]"                         (default 20,26,up)
--   AA_RUNG    the voxel camera rung                  (default 5, the 75 one)
--
-- The scene defaults to a town at the LOW camera on purpose: roof ridges, the
-- diagonal of a fence and a tree's silhouette against the sky are the edges
-- that stair-step, and 75 degrees is the rung that puts the most of them at an
-- angle to the pixel grid.
--
-- Determinism matters here for the same reason it does in voxel_shots_ab: the
-- three shots differ ONLY by the row under test, or comparing them means
-- nothing. The clock is pinned, the animated tile slots are frozen, the
-- townsfolk are stopped where they stand, and the tilt-shift is held at zero
-- (a gaussian over the frame would smear away the very edges being looked at).
--
-- Nothing here writes the player's options: the row is moved with
-- ModSetting:sync, which moves the cached index and persists nothing.
