-- Driver: the pixel-identity gate for performance work.
--
-- Every optimization in this mod's performance pass claims the frame comes
-- out the same. This driver is what makes that claim checkable rather than
-- asserted: it renders a fixed set of scenes -- several maps, indoors and
-- out, at every camera rung, in every display mode -- and writes one PNG
-- per scene. Run it before a change and after it, hash the two directories,
-- and any file whose hash moved is a scene the change altered.
--
--   POKEPORT_DRIVER=mods/DramaticShapeVoxelMod/tests/voxel_shots_ab.lua \
--   SHOT_DIR=<dir> AB_TAG=before lovec.exe .
--
-- knobs (env):
--   SHOT_DIR   output directory (created if missing)   (default "shots/ab")
--   AB_TAG     subdirectory under SHOT_DIR             (default "before")
--   AB_MODES   display modes to sweep, comma list      (default all four)
--
-- DETERMINISM is the whole game here, because a shot that differs for a
-- reason other than the change under test makes the gate useless:
--
--   * the day/night clock is PINNED (an unpinned sky is a different sky
--     every second, and it drives the sun angle and the shadow frustum);
--   * the animated tile slots ride the engine's 60Hz counter, so every
--     scene is reached after the SAME number of frames from the same
--     starting state, and the water is at the same point in its roll;
--   * levels are set through Pipelines.setLevel, never the hotkey, so the
--     run cannot write the player's options;
--   * encounters are stubbed off -- a wild battle would replace the scene
--     the shot is named for.
