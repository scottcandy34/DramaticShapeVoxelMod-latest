-- Driver: which building models exist, and how much of this map is
-- claimed by objects?
--
-- Buildings.build matches every profiled template against the whole map
-- and stamps each hit, so two templates whose tile grids both match one
-- drawing stamp TWO models into the same cells.
--
-- READ THE CAVEAT BEFORE TRUSTING THIS. Buildings.stats() reports the
-- module's `models` cache, which is keyed "<tileset>:<index>" and is
-- GLOBAL AND CUMULATIVE for the session -- it lists every model built
-- since boot, including ones from maps visited earlier, and says nothing
-- about where they were placed. It is a memoisation table, not a
-- placement log. Reading it as "what is on this map" will convince you a
-- foreign building has stamped here when it has not.
--
-- To answer "does template X place on map Y", match its `tiles` grid
-- against the map's tile grid OFFLINE (the map and tileset tables the
-- ROM importer writes into the player's own cache -- see
-- tools/voxel-survey.md for the paths) -- no engine needed, and it gives
-- you the coordinates.
-- And note a drawing can STRADDLE A MAP BOUNDARY (the Pokemon Tower's
-- roof is on ROUTE_10, its facade on LAVENDER_TOWN), in which case no
-- single map's grid holds the whole thing and each half meshes alone.
