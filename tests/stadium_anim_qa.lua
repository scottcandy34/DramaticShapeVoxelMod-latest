--
-- Run from the PROJECT ROOT.
--
-- ------- what this is for
--
-- A battle asks a species for one of its animations and then poses, skins,
-- re-textures and draws it sixty times a second. Nothing in that chain is
-- exercised by the pack probe, which reads the format and walks a bind pose,
-- and nothing in it is exercised by the shot drivers, which show one species
-- in one animation at a time. So the failures that only some species have --
-- a texture index nothing maps, an animation that throws a bone into orbit,
-- a track that indexes off its own end -- have had no way of being found
-- except by a player calling that Pokemon out.
--
-- This is that sweep, headless: the REAL StadiumPack, the REAL StadiumRig
-- and the REAL StadiumMon over stubs for the three things a graphics context
-- provides (a mesh, an image, the draw call). Every species, every animation
-- it carries, every frame of it, plus the battle state machine over every
-- one of the 165 move slots.
--
-- ------- the stubs are not lenient
--
-- The fake mesh and the fake image behave like LOVE's do in the one way that
-- matters: an object that has been released THROWS when it is used, with
-- LOVE's own message. That is deliberate -- a released texture reaching a
-- draw call is a real failure mode of this mode (see the LRU note in
-- StadiumPack), and a stub that quietly accepted one would hide exactly the
-- class of bug this sweep exists to find.
