-- Run from the PROJECT ROOT.
--
-- ------- why this is a test and not a note
--
-- The extraction is pure Lua on purpose -- no FFI, no native helper, no
-- second process -- specifically so it can run everywhere LOVE does, phones
-- included. That claim is about MEMORY as much as about which functions
-- exist: a desktop will not notice a transient peak that would have a mobile
-- OS kill the process, and the peak is not visible by reading the code.
--
-- So this measures it, and fails if the two things that must stay bounded
-- stop being bounded:
--
--   the WORKING SET must not grow with the number of species done, or the
--   build gets heavier the longer it runs and dies somewhere in the 140s
--
--   the PEAK must stay under a budget a phone can be expected to have
--   spare, on top of a game that is already running
--
-- The ROM itself is most of the floor and cannot be avoided -- the archive is
-- addressed by absolute offset -- so it is reported separately from the
-- per-species work built on top of it.
