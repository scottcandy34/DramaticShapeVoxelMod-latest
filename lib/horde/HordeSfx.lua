-- HORDE MODE: the gun, in Game Boy hardware.
--
-- Every sound this mode makes is SYNTHESIZED on the same emulated APU the
-- rest of the game speaks through -- no sample files ship with the mod.
-- That is a deliberate aesthetic choice as much as a legal one: Lavender
-- Town is playing, the cries are the real cries, and a 44kHz foley
-- gunshot dropped on top would read as a different program running in the
-- same window. Authored here with ChipAsm (src/audio/ChipAsm.lua), which
-- assembles note tables into the channel bytecode ChipAudio interprets.
--
-- WHAT A GUNSHOT IS, on this hardware. Channel 4 is a noise generator
-- whose `parameter` byte is NR43: the high nibble is the shift clock (LOW
-- values are BRIGHT, high values are low rumble), bit 3 picks the short
-- 7-bit LFSR (metallic and pitched) over the long 15-bit one (white
-- hiss), and the low three bits divide. A real gunshot is a bright crack
-- collapsing into a body and then a room tail, so each sound here is a
-- STAGED program: three or four noise notes marching down the parameter
-- byte, each shorter-lived than the last. `len` is in frames of 1/60s,
-- `volume` is 0-15, and `fade` is the envelope period -- 1 decays fastest,
-- 7 slowest, 0 holds for the note's whole length.
--
-- The shot also gets two frames of channel 1 underneath it: a square note
-- swept hard downward, which is the only way to put a low thump on this
-- chip. It costs the music its lead channel for 1/30s per shot, which is
-- inaudible as interference and is most of what makes the shot feel like
-- it has weight.
--
-- THREE SHOT VARIANTS, round-robined. Sound.play caches ONE Source per
-- registered name and restarts it (stop then play), so firing twice on
-- one name cuts the first shot's tail off. Three names means three
-- Sources, so a fast trigger finger overlaps its own echoes the way a
-- real one does -- and the variants differ slightly in their tails, which
-- takes the machine-gun sameness off a repeated sound.
