-- Voxel world mode: free movement for the free-roam rungs.
--
-- The engine walks a grid: sixteen frames per cell, four directions,
-- input locked mid-step. Inside a camera that stands with the player that
-- gait reads as riding a rail, so while 1ST or 3RD drives, this module
-- replaces the WALK and nothing else: the player's position becomes
-- continuous, steered by the camera's own yaw -- push forward and you go
-- where you look, at any angle, sliding along whatever you graze.
--
-- Both rungs walk identically: the boom behind the shoulder (3RD) changes
-- where the eye stands, not which way it points, and the walk was always
-- rotated by the YAW. The one thing it does change is which way the body
-- POINTS while it moves -- see bodyFacing in the tick.
--
-- THE GRID IS STILL THE GAME. Every fact the world cares about is a fact
-- about cells -- what blocks, what warps, what rustles, what bites -- and
-- this module keeps the player's logical cell synced to wherever the free
-- walk stands, then reuses the engine's own machinery for every one of
-- those questions:
--
--   passability      the same isWalkableCell / water-while-surfing /
--                    tile-pair / entity-occupancy verdicts Collision
--                    hands the grid walker, asked per cell the player's
--                    body overlaps.
--
--   cell arrival     OverworldState:onStepComplete, the same landing
--                    pipeline a grid step runs -- warps, spinners, gates,
--                    forced currents, poison, repel, encounters, the
--                    step counters -- fired once per cell crossed, which
--                    is exactly the rate a grid walk fires it.
--
--   the special pushes   walking off the map edge, into a ledge, or into
--                    a boulder hands the quantised direction straight to
--                    checkEdgeExit / checkLedgeHop / checkBoulderPush,
--                    the engine's own handlers, which validate and stage
--                    everything themselves (connections, the hop arc,
--                    the two-push arm). While any of those animates a
--                    scripted grid move, this module stands aside and
--                    adopts the result.
--
-- Nothing here writes save state, rolls encounters, or decides what a
-- warp does -- it moves a point, keeps the cell honest, and lets the
-- engine be the engine. Stepping off the rung snaps the point to its
-- cell and hands the walk back to the grid, and with the rung off this
-- module costs one gate check per frame.

-- the tile pair, checkEdgeExit checks the bounds), so calling them on
-- every firm push is safe. Returns true when one of them took the frame
-- over.
--

-- is a discrete event -- you pressed a direction, the game refused, and
-- the bump answers you once. A free walk has no such moment: the body
-- SLIDES along whatever it grazes, so a player walking a fence line or
-- rounding a doorframe is blocked on one axis continuously, and the same
-- sound comes out as a rattle for as long as they keep walking. It is
-- feedback for a refusal that is not happening. The grid walk keeps its
