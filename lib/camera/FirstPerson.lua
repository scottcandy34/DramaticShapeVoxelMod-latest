-- Voxel world mode: the free-roam camera -- the 1ST and 3RD rungs.
--
-- Every other rung is the same camera at a different pitch: an orbit over
-- the view centre, described by one number. 1ST is a different rig
-- entirely: the eye stands in the player's own head, the view direction is
-- the player's to steer -- mouse, right stick or a touch drag -- and the
-- rig rides the placed-camera seam (Voxel3D.camera) that the staged battle
-- already proved out. Everything downstream of that seam -- the shader
-- uniforms, project(), the sky's vanishing line, the water's lean -- reads
-- eye and focus the same way it always has.
--
-- 3RD is that same rig with the eye pulled back onto a boom behind the
-- player's shoulder (lib/ThirdPerson.lua). Everything in this file is
-- already general over where the eye stands -- the attitude, the look
-- inputs, the move intent, the cards that turn to face the eye -- so the
-- third-person rung is one number applied at the very end of frame(),
-- rather than a second camera to keep in step with this one.
--
-- What this module owns:
--
--   the ATTITUDE   yaw and pitch, fed by whichever look input speaks:
--                  relative mouse motion, the right stick's rate, or a
--                  touch dragged across open screen. All three drive the
--                  same two numbers, so they compose instead of fighting.
--
--   the BLEND      easing between the orbit and the head. Stepping onto
--                  the rung dives the camera from wherever the orbit was
--                  into the player's eyes over half a second; stepping off
--                  flies it back out. Mid-blend the rig is a straight lerp
--                  of the two cameras -- eye, focus, fov, up -- through
--                  the same placed-camera record.
--
--   the MOVE INTENT   the analog vector FreeMove walks the player by,
--                  gathered here because it is made of the same devices:
--                  the left stick's raw axes, the touch d-pad's true
--                  deflection, or the held keys, rotated by this camera's
--                  yaw so "forward" means "where I am looking".
--
-- Deliberately NOT here: movement itself (lib/FreeMove.lua, which owns the
-- collision walk and the grid the game logic still lives on), and the
-- billboard math that faces cards at this eye (VoxelScene, which owns
-- every other card matrix too).
--
-- Everything the module reaches -- the mouse's relative mode, the wrapped
-- love handlers, the touch overlay's hit test -- is pcall-guarded the same
-- way the 3D pass is: headless runs and drivers without a mouse simply
-- never see the input, and the rung falls back to holding the 75-degree
-- orbit.
