-- The player's own camera controls: zoom everywhere, and the battle's orbit.
--
-- This mod has four cameras, and by the time a wheel notch arrives they all
-- want it. So one module owns the INPUTS and answers the only question that
-- matters -- which camera is this aimed at -- rather than each camera
-- growing its own wheel handler and racing the others for the event:
--
--   a staged battle      the camera the fight is shot with (BattleCam): the
--                        wheel and Q/E work its lens, and the right stick,
--                        a drag or the mouse walk it around the arena.
--
--   the 3RD rung         the boom behind the player's shoulder
--                        (ThirdPerson): the wheel, Q/E and a pinch let it
--                        out and pull it in.
--
--   an orbit rung        the engine's own survey zoom, which the wheel has
--                        always driven -- so here the module mostly gets
--                        out of the way, and only ADDS the two keys and the
--                        pinch that the engine has no handler for.
--
--   the 1ST rung         nothing. The eye is in the player's head; there is
--                        no distance to change, and a pinch there would
--                        silently wind the survey zoom for whenever they
--                        stepped back out. Inputs pass through untouched.
--
-- Every claim is answered by a GATE rather than by a mode flag, and every
-- wrap forwards whatever it does not claim -- so with voxel mode off, and
-- on every screen that is not the overworld or a battle, each byte flows
-- exactly where it always did.
--
-- Installed AFTER FirstPerson (see main.lua), which makes these wraps the
-- outer ones: a battle's controls get first refusal on the mouse and the
-- touch screen, which is right, because while a fight is staged the
-- free-roam look is not driving anyway.

--
-- PINCH_SLACK is how far apart two fingers must travel, as a ratio of

-- it a two-finger tap wobbles rather than zooms.
--
-- SURVEY_PINCH is how many of the engine's integer survey steps one
-- doubling of the finger gap is worth. The survey ladder is coarse (whole
-- pixels per world pixel), so a pinch has to be geared down or the first
-- centimetre of travel crosses the whole range.

-- ------- gates

-- A fight staged on the map, drawn and on screen. Asked of the shot rather
-- than of the battle state, because the shot is exactly "there is a 3D
-- battle in front of the player right now" -- with 3D-BTL off, or on a map
-- with no arena, the engine's own flat battle screen is up and its camera
-- is not ours to steer.
-- BACK SPRITES also closes it, through BattleCam.steerable: that setting
-- nails the player's own mon to the GB's slot on the menu while the foe
-- stands out on the map, and no camera angle holds a composition that is
-- half frame and half world (see BattleCam.steerable, which is where the
-- reasoning lives and which the RIG answers to as well -- so a stored
-- angle from before the setting was switched on stands down with it).
