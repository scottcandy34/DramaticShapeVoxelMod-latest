-- Voxel world mode: resolve every tile of a tileset to an extrusion shape.
--
-- Reads the hand-authored groups in data/voxel_heights.lua and fills the
-- gaps from data the ROM extractor already emits. Resolution happens at two
-- granularities, and the order matters:
--
--   per tile   1. a group named in data/voxel_heights.lua  (hand-authored)
--   per CELL   2. the cell is water                        -> "water"
--              3. the cell is walkable                     -> "ground"
--   per tile   4. tile-level fallback: the map's water set -> "water",
--                 its walkable set -> "ground", else       -> "wall"
--
-- The cell steps (TileShape.at) are the load-bearing part. Collision in
-- this engine -- like the GB original -- is defined per 16x16 CELL, judged
-- by the cell's bottom-left 8x8 tile alone. The other three tiles of a
-- cell carry no collision meaning, and treating their walkable-list
-- membership as one (which is what a pure per-tile lookup does) misfiles
-- every decorative tile: flowers become 16px pillars, the gap tiles of a
-- fence row become wall, grass tufts extrude. A tile in a walkable cell is
-- ground the player is standing on, whatever the walkable list says about
-- it; hand-authoring (rule 1) is the only thing that overrides that.
--
-- Rule 4 covers positions whose cell IS blocked: there, walkable-listed
-- tiles (the gaps between fence posts) stay ground and the rest rise.
--
-- Every class also carries an ART mode, which is what the mesher renders:
--
--   flat     ground/water/void: a single quad, no box.
--   top      ledge/roof: a box with its art on the TOP face -- things
--            whose 2D art depicts a surface seen from above.
--   upright  wall/tree/fence/sign: a box whose SOUTH face reconstructs
--            the 2D artwork standing up (the mesher's fold-up rule) --
--            things whose 2D art depicts a surface seen face-on, which is
--            most of Gen 1: interior walls, furniture, tree canopies,
--            building facades.
--
-- Purely presentational: a shape decides how a tile DRAWS in voxel mode
-- and nothing else. Collision still reads the same walkable list it
-- always did.

-- the wall's dark base course AND for every service counter's front, and
-- it is the bottom row of its cell either way. Pinned `wall` the counter
-- stands a full 16px; pinned `counter` the wall bank corrugates 16/8 for
-- sixteen rows. Neither is right, and no per-tile pin can be, because
-- forMap resolves an id to ONE shape.
--
-- What separates the two uses is what is drawn ABOVE: the wall's upper
-- course over a wall base, the counter's top over a counter front. So a
-- profile entry may carry `when_above = { [tile] = { { above = {...},
-- class = "..." } } }`, evaluated per POSITION in TileShape.at, where
-- the map and coordinates are in hand. First match wins; no match keeps
-- the tile's ordinary pin.
-- `when_below` is the mirror, and it exists because ABOVE is not always the
-- side that tells the two uses apart.  The Plateau's $0D is the case: it is
-- the gate wall's top band AND the base course under a column of rock face,
-- and scanned over both maps the tile above is $03 for 64 of the first and
-- 140 of the second -- no rule on `above` can split them.  What is BELOW

-- same shades as its furniture.  So the profile authors the silhouette

-- No class -- what the entry carries instead is a `depth`, or does not:
--
--   WITHOUT one it is a flat sprite card, drawn the way SpriteBillboards
--   draws a character.  That is the right reading for a PERSON: a Gen 1
--   figure is a face-on 2D icon, and extruding one reconstructs a body
--   nobody drew (see Structures.buildFigures).
--   WITH one it is an OBJECT and gets the standee treatment every other
--   solid here gets -- a per-pixel slab in world space, standing on the
--   same furniture the card would have stood on.  The Marts' cash
--   register is the case: a machine on a counter is a box, not an icon.
--
-- `model` is the third answer, and the only one that is not an extrusion
-- of the drawing at all: an AUTHORED solid, given as plan layers bottom
-- first, standing at the FRONT of the support cell.  It exists for a
-- drawing too small to un-project -- the Centers' push bell is 7x6 pixels
-- of ¾-view dome, and no reading of six rows produces a shape a mask can
-- extrude without inventing more than it measures.  What it still may not
-- invent is COLOUR: each layer names the atlas texel its top and its
-- sides wear, so the solid is painted out of the drawing it replaces and
-- follows every palette bake exactly like the rest of this file.
--
-- Two fields say which parts of such a drawing are NOT the extrusion,
-- because a solid drawn in one 16x16 GB cell still packs more than one
-- facing:
--
--   `thin` caps the thickness over the mask's top rows, for the part of
--   the drawing that is not the machine (the register's receipt curl).
--   `flat` names a rect of the mask that is a TOP-VIEW surface rather
--   than a face -- the register's keypad, whose keys lie ON its deck.
--   The rect lays horizontal one voxel proud of whatever the extrusion
--   leaves below it, at the elevation its BOTTOM row would have had,
--   with drawn row = depth row 1:1 (the mapping the lab tabletop is
--   drawn with).  So a drawing whose front elevation is an L reads as

-- Hand-authored MOUNTED objects for one tileset: a thing drawn INTO the

-- Same authoring problem as `figures` and the same answer -- a class pin
-- resolves a whole 8x8 tile, and the detector cannot segment a drawing
-- that has no background margin to flood from.  The Bike Shop's two wall
-- bicycles are the case: the shop's striped wall panel runs BEHIND them,
-- and its #555 stripes are a flood boundary, so a silhouette flood comes
-- back with the stripes attached to the bike.
--
-- Two things differ from a figure, and both follow from the object being
-- an object rather than a character:
--
--   it keeps its DRAWN ELEVATION.  A figure stands on its own feet; a
--   mounted thing sits where the wall band draws it, so a bicycle hung
--   clear of the floor stays hung.
--   it has THICKNESS (`depth`, default 2), and it is built in world
--   space as a per-pixel slab jutting south of the band -- not as a
--   camera-facing sprite card.  A bicycle drawn side-on is a plane
--   parallel to the wall, not a face-on icon.
