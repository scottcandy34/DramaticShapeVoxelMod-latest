-- Voxel world mode: turn a map's tile layer into one static 3D mesh.
--
-- The scene description comes from Structures.lua, which -- 3dSen-style --
-- detects each connected drawn thing on the map and picks its model:
--
--   flat      ground / water / void: a single quad.
--   top art   ledges, roofs (profile-authored): a box with the art on its
--             TOP face; partial side bands crop the art (a 6px ledge face
--             is the bottom of the lip drawing).
--   volume    walls, buildings, tree lines: each column rises to the
--             structure's REAL drawn height (Structures measures it,
--             repeat-aware and region-consistent -- a 6-row house is 48px,
--             a 40-row border forest is rows of 16px trees). The south
--             face folds the full artwork upright, 8px band by band, band
--             k sampling the map row k tiles north; the top wears the
--             structure's top rows.
--   object    small props with a silhouette (plants, signs, lone trees):
--             per-pixel voxel prisms prebuilt by Structures, standing on
--             synthesized ground -- this mesher just emits their quads.
--             Round trees arrive as STAMPS (a shared hull template plus a
--             cell offset) and expand here, straight into the vertex
--             stream, so no map retains per-cell copies of its forests.
--
-- Side faces are never stretched: all sides are 8px bands with the art
-- tiled per band and cropped at partial bands.
--
-- Texturing samples the TILESET ATLAS, not a rendered copy of the map. The
-- atlas is 128x48; a map-space canvas covering the biggest routes would be
-- ~5 MB each with up to five live at once (connected maps), which is real
-- memory on the mobile targets. Sampling the atlas costs 24 KB, and costs
-- nothing in fidelity because TerrainAtlas hands back the same atlas
-- TileRenderer draws with -- including the fully recolored one RED++
-- bakes -- so terrain color comes through untouched.
--
-- BUILDS ARE ASYNCHRONOUS. A frame never blocks on meshing: VoxelScene
-- requests what it wants to draw, request() queues a build job, and
-- pump() -- called once a frame from the pipeline's update -- advances
-- the queue inside a few-millisecond budget (BuildBudget suspends the
-- job's coroutine mid-loop when the slice is spent). Until a mesh lands
-- the scene simply draws without it: the engine's flat path while the
-- current map has nothing, the body-only variant while the full one (the
-- border ring) is still cooking, neighbours popping in as they finish.
-- The synchronous get() remains for probes and tests.
--
-- Meshes are cached per map id and EVICTED down to the live set (current
-- map + connected neighbours) whenever that set changes -- setLive()
-- releases far maps' GPU meshes and their Structures analysis, which is
-- what used to grow the heap by gigabytes over a cross-region trek.
