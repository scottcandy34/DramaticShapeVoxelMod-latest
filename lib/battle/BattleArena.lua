-- Overworld battles: where the fight is staged.
--
-- A battle in this mod happens ON THE MAP, so it needs a patch of ground
-- clear enough to stand two Pokemon on and point a camera down. This module
-- finds it: the nearest patch of open cells, in the shape below.
--
--     x x x
--     x O x        O   the enemy's mon
--     x x x
--     x x x
--     x P x        P   the player's mon
--     x x x
--
-- Every `x` is an OPEN cell -- one with no obstruction, i.e. one the player
-- could walk onto. The two mons stand three cells apart down the middle
-- column, with a one-cell apron all round so the camera looks across floor
-- rather than into a wall.
--
-- When no map has room for that -- a corridor, a cave, a shop floor -- the
-- search relaxes to the narrow shape, which is the same three-cell gap with
-- the apron given up:
--
--     O
--     x
--     x
--     P
--
-- and if even that will not fit, the caller gets nil and the battle draws
-- the way it always did. A mod that cannot find a stage does not invent
-- one.
--
-- Nothing here MOVES anybody: the arena is where the CAMERA goes and where
-- the two mons are staged for the shot. The player's own cell, the party,
-- every script and flag are exactly where the battle left them, which is
-- what keeps a trainer's post-battle dialogue talking to someone still
-- standing in front of them.

-- ------- the authored spot
--
-- Every map gets ONE place its battles happen, chosen once and written down
-- in data/battle_arenas.lua, rather than whatever clearing happens to be
-- nearest to wherever the fight started. Two reasons.
--
-- A fight should look the same every time it happens somewhere. Picking the
-- nearest patch means Route 1 has a dozen different battle scenes depending
-- on which step of the grass you were on, some of them behind a tree.
--
-- And "open ground" is not the same question as "you can SEE the two of
-- them". The camera is low and a long way back, so a hedge, a ledge lip or a
-- building corner anywhere along that line hides a mon completely while the
-- cells it stands on are perfectly walkable. That is what `clearance` below
-- measures, and it is what the authored list is chosen against.
--
-- A map with no entry falls back to the search, so a mod that adds maps, or
-- an entry that goes stale, degrades to the old behaviour rather than to no
-- battle.
-- An entry may also name ANOTHER MAP to stage on:
--
--   ["MT_MOON_B2F"] = { map = "MT_MOON_1F", x = 12, y = 8, shape = "wide" }
--
-- because some maps simply have nowhere to put a fight. A cave's lower floor
-- can be nothing but two-cell-wide corridors between rock walls; a gym is a
-- room full of furniture. Rather than stage a battle there badly -- both
-- Pokemon behind a boulder -- the fight is shot on a floor of the SAME cave,
-- or a floor of the same building, that does have the room for it. It is the
-- same place, and no worse a fiction than a battle happening on ground the
-- player is not standing on, which is what every one of these already is.

}

-- ------- which way round the fight stands
--
-- Both shapes above are drawn north-south, with the foe at the top and the
-- player below it, and the camera is solved for that: it sits off the
-- player's shoulder, low and back down the arena's own axis. `turn` swings
-- the WHOLE staging a quarter at a time -- the footprint, the two cells, and
-- the camera with them -- so the composition on screen is identical and only
-- the ground under it is different.
--
-- It buys two things.
--
-- A footprint that FITS. The wide shape is three cells by six; an east-west
-- corridor two cells deep has no room for it standing up and all the room in
-- the world for it lying down. Half the maps in Kanto run the other way from
-- the one shape this mode was drawn in.
--
-- And a BACKDROP. A quarter turn moves the camera to a different side of the
-- same patch of ground, so the wall behind the pair becomes the window
-- behind them, or the cliff becomes the valley. Nothing about the shot's
-- geometry changes -- the mons land on the same two screen anchors at the
-- same size -- so this is purely a choice about what is behind them, made
-- per map by somebody looking at it.
--
-- Written in DEGREES in data/battle_arenas.lua (`turn = 90`) because that is
-- what it is; handled as quarter turns everywhere below.

-- Whether a cell is open ground for the purpose above.
--
-- "Open" is the walk test the player themselves answer to, so an arena can
-- never be laid over a wall, a counter, a tree or a ledge face. Water counts
-- only for a surfer, which is the one case where the player is standing on
-- it too -- a sea battle staged on the beach half a route away would read as
-- a teleport.
--
-- Warp cells are excluded on top of that. They are walkable by definition
-- (they are the doormat), and a fight framed in a doorway both looks wrong
-- and puts the camera inside the building's geometry.
--
-- And TALL GRASS is excluded, which is the surprising one, because grass is
-- where wild battles come from and standing in it is the obvious place to
-- have one. It does not survive contact with the camera. Grass is real
-- geometry in this mode -- a row of tufts about knee height on a Pokemon --
-- drawn with the same camera-ward bias that lets it overdraw a walking
-- character's feet in the free-roam world. From a camera nearly level with
-- the floor that bias stops being feet-deep: the tufts on and around a mon's
-- own tile stand between it and the lens and eat most of the sprite.
--
-- So the arena is laid on bare ground -- the whole footprint, not just the
-- two cells a mon stands on, because the apron south of the near mon is
-- exactly the row whose grass would cover it. Grass FURTHER back toward the
-- camera is fine and stays: it is far enough forward to project low and wide
-- across the bottom of the frame, where it reads as a field rather than as
-- something in the way.
