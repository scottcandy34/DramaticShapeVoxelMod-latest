-- Overworld battles: one frame of the arena, as geometry.
--
-- The same world the free-roam mode draws, from a placed camera instead of
-- the orbit, at the WINDOW's own pixel resolution -- not the GB's. The
-- backdrop reaches the screen through Renderer's worldOverride, the seam a
-- render pipeline's finished world image already composites through, which
-- is drawn one canvas pixel to one screen pixel; the 160x144 battle screen
-- then blits over it in the classic letterbox. So the world is as crisp as
-- the free-roam diorama and the pics, HUDs and text box stay exactly the
-- chunky GB art they are.
--
-- Rendering the whole window rather than just the letterbox means the
-- framing has to be split in two. The RIG frames the GB's 160x144 (see
-- BattleCam, which is solved against coordinates in that frame); this
-- module widens the lens by exactly the ratio the window bears to the
-- letterbox, so the letterbox sub-rectangle of what gets rendered is
-- bit-for-bit the framing the rig asked for, and everything outside it is
-- extra picture. That is what lets the two mons be PINNED: their cells
-- project to the same GB coordinates at any window size or zoom.
--
-- Characters are deliberately absent. The overworld cast is culled for the
-- length of the battle (see OverworldBattle), so this pass has terrain,
-- grass and flowers and nothing that walks -- the arena is empty, which is
-- what makes it an arena.
--
-- Everything expensive is shared with the free-roam mode rather than
-- duplicated: the same chunk meshes out of ChunkMesher, the same palette
-- atlas out of TerrainAtlas, the same sun out of ShadowMap. A battle on a
-- map already meshed for walking around costs the frame it draws and
-- nothing else.

--

-- the sun does not care about.
-- ------- the two mons, hung on their cells
--
-- The billboard texture is the battle screen's own 160x144 pics layer with
-- one side rendered into it (see OverworldBattle.sideTexture), so the quad is
-- that whole frame stood up on the map -- which is what carries every pic
-- effect the engine applies without any of them being reimplemented here.
--
-- Its size follows from one number: a full 7x7-tile mon covers one overworld
-- square, so a canvas pixel is FULL_W / FULL_PIC world pixels and the card is
-- the canvas at that scale. Its placement follows from the anchor the
-- texture reports -- the column the pic was centred on and the row its feet
-- were put on -- which is translated onto the cell before the card is stood
-- up, so a mon of any size in any pose has its feet on the ground.
-- `mirror` flips the card about its own anchor column. Both mons wear their
-- FRONT pic, which is drawn facing out of the screen -- so dropped into the
-- world unaltered the pair stand back to back, both looking the same way past
-- each other. Mirroring the near one turns it to face the far one, which is
-- what a fight looks like; and because it is a flip about the pic's own
-- centre the feet do not move off the tile.
--
-- The player's TRAINER pic is the exception, and it is exempted below. That
-- one is a BACK view -- the player seen from behind, already turned to face
-- up the field -- so it arrives pointing the right way and mirroring it would
-- turn it around to face the camera it is standing in front of.
