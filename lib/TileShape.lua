-- Voxel world mode: resolve every tile of a tileset to an extrusion shape.
--
-- Reads the hand-authored groups in data/voxel_heights.lua and fills the
-- gaps from data the ROM extractor already emits. Resolution happens at two
-- granularities, and the order matters:
--
--   per tile   1. a group named in data/voxel_heights.lua  (hand-authored)
--   per CELL   2. the cell is water                        -> "water"
--              3. the cell is walkable                     -> "ground"
--   per tile   4. tile-level fallback: the map's water set -> "water",
--                 its walkable set -> "ground", else       -> "wall"
--
-- The cell steps (TileShape.at) are the load-bearing part. Collision in
-- this engine -- like the GB original -- is defined per 16x16 CELL, judged
-- by the cell's bottom-left 8x8 tile alone. The other three tiles of a
-- cell carry no collision meaning, and treating their walkable-list
-- membership as one (which is what a pure per-tile lookup does) misfiles
-- every decorative tile: flowers become 16px pillars, the gap tiles of a
-- fence row become wall, grass tufts extrude. A tile in a walkable cell is
-- ground the player is standing on, whatever the walkable list says about
-- it; hand-authoring (rule 1) is the only thing that overrides that.
--
-- Rule 4 covers positions whose cell IS blocked: there, walkable-listed
-- tiles (the gaps between fence posts) stay ground and the rest rise.
--
-- Every class also carries an ART mode, which is what the mesher renders:
--
--   flat     ground/water/void: a single quad, no box.
--   top      ledge/roof: a box with its art on the TOP face -- things
--            whose 2D art depicts a surface seen from above.
--   upright  wall/tree/fence/sign: a box whose SOUTH face reconstructs
--            the 2D artwork standing up (the mesher's fold-up rule) --
--            things whose 2D art depicts a surface seen face-on, which is
--            most of Gen 1: interior walls, furniture, tree canopies,
--            building facades.
--
-- Purely presentational: a shape decides how a tile DRAWS in voxel mode
-- and nothing else. Collision still reads the same walkable list it
-- always did.

-- A pin is per TILE ID, and one graphic can mean two things. The route

-- the wall's dark base course AND for every service counter's front, and
-- it is the bottom row of its cell either way. Pinned `wall` the counter
-- stands a full 16px; pinned `counter` the wall bank corrugates 16/8 for
-- sixteen rows. Neither is right, and no per-tile pin can be, because
-- forMap resolves an id to ONE shape.
--
-- What separates the two uses is what is drawn ABOVE: the wall's upper
-- course over a wall base, the counter's top over a counter front. So a
-- profile entry may carry `when_above = { [tile] = { { above = {...},
-- class = "..." } } }`, evaluated per POSITION in TileShape.at, where
-- the map and coordinates are in hand. First match wins; no match keeps
-- the tile's ordinary pin.
-- `when_below` is the mirror, and it exists because ABOVE is not always the
-- side that tells the two uses apart.  The Plateau's $0D is the case: it is
-- the gate wall's top band AND the base course under a column of rock face,
-- and scanned over both maps the tile above is $03 for 64 of the first and
-- 140 of the second -- no rule on `above` can split them.  What is BELOW
-- does, exactly: the wall's own face $0F sits under the top band and under

-- Hand-authored FIGURES for one tileset: a drawing painted INTO furniture,
-- cut out by an explicit pixel mask and stood up on top of it.
--
-- Every other route in this file resolves a whole 8x8 TILE, which is
-- exactly why none of them can reach a figure that shares its tiles with
-- the thing it sits on -- and the detector's segmentation cannot either
-- when the drawing has no background margin to flood from and wears the
-- same shades as its furniture.  So the profile authors the silhouette
-- pixel by pixel (see data/voxel_heights.lua):
--
--   figures = { { w      = <tiles across>,
--                 depth  = <voxels of body; ABSENT for a person>,
--                 model  = { ...authored plan layers, bottom first... },
--                 inset  = <voxels back from the support cell's front>,
--                 thin   = { rows = <top rows>, depth = <voxels> },
--                 flat   = { x = { <lx0>, <lx1> }, rows = { <r0>, <r1> } },
--                 tiles  = { ...w*h tile ids, row-major... },
--                 under  = { ...w*h ids: what each tile wears once the
--                            figure is lifted off it... },
--                 pixels = { ...h*8 strings of w*8 chars, "." = not the
--                            figure... } } }
--
-- No class -- what the entry carries instead is a `depth`, or does not:
--
--   WITHOUT one it is a flat sprite card, drawn the way SpriteBillboards
--   draws a character.  That is the right reading for a PERSON: a Gen 1
--   figure is a face-on 2D icon, and extruding one reconstructs a body
--   nobody drew (see Structures.buildFigures).
--   WITH one it is an OBJECT and gets the standee treatment every other
--   solid here gets -- a per-pixel slab in world space, standing on the
--   same furniture the card would have stood on.  The Marts' cash
--   register is the case: a machine on a counter is a box, not an icon.
--
-- `model` is the third answer, and the only one that is not an extrusion
-- of the drawing at all: an AUTHORED solid, given as plan layers bottom
-- first, standing at the FRONT of the support cell.  It exists for a
-- drawing too small to un-project -- the Centers' push bell is 7x6 pixels
-- of ¾-view dome, and no reading of six rows produces a shape a mask can
-- extrude without inventing more than it measures.  What it still may not
-- invent is COLOUR: each layer names the atlas texel its top and its
-- sides wear, so the solid is painted out of the drawing it replaces and
-- follows every palette bake exactly like the rest of this file.
--
-- Two fields say which parts of such a drawing are NOT the extrusion,
-- because a solid drawn in one 16x16 GB cell still packs more than one
-- facing:
--
--   `thin` caps the thickness over the mask's top rows, for the part of
--   the drawing that is not the machine (the register's receipt curl).
--   `flat` names a rect of the mask that is a TOP-VIEW surface rather
--   than a face -- the register's keypad, whose keys lie ON its deck.
--   The rect lays horizontal one voxel proud of whatever the extrusion
--   leaves below it, at the elevation its BOTTOM row would have had,
--   with drawn row = depth row 1:1 (the mapping the lab tabletop is
--   drawn with).  So a drawing whose front elevation is an L reads as
--   one: body up the side and along the base, keys lying in the notch.
--
-- Returned normalized: `mask` as a set keyed by ly * (w * 8) + lx, so
-- Structures can read it as a bitmap without re-parsing per position.
-- A malformed entry is dropped rather than half-applied -- a typo in a
-- mask should leave the couch alone, not carve a hole in it.
--
-- `mounted` (below) carries the same four fields, so the parse is shared,
-- and so are the optional ones that give an authored mask a BODY: `depth`,
-- `thin` and `flat` above.  `depth` is left nil when unstated, because
-- absence is meaningful on a figure: no depth means the flat sprite card a
-- person is drawn as.
