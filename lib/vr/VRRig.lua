-- VR: the pose arithmetic -- how a headset eye becomes one of this mod's
-- cameras. Pure math on purpose: no FFI, no OpenXR types, nothing a
-- headless test cannot hold still. Everything device-shaped stays in
-- VRXR/VRGL; everything world-shaped is here.
--
-- Two ways the world can sit around a headset, and they mirror the VOXEL
-- ladder exactly:
--
--   DIORAMA   every orbit rung. The map is a tabletop miniature: a point
--             of the world (the view centre) is pinned VIEW_DIST away
--             along the rung's own viewing angle (dioramaAnchor), at the
--             scale that reproduces the flat screen's framing
--             (dioramaScale) -- so at rest the model presents exactly as
--             the standard view does, and the head moves freely around it
--             -- lean in and the town grows, walk around the table and
--             see the far side of the buildings honest occlusion has been
--             hiding.
--
--   FIRST_PERSON   the 1ST rung. The player's head is pinned to where the
--             headset started, at FP_SCALE, so a 16-pixel person stands
--             about 1.6 m tall and a cell is a stride. The HMD's own
--             orientation becomes FirstPerson's yaw and pitch, so movement
--             stays "push forward, go where you look" through the same
--             FreeMove the flat screen uses.
--
-- SPACES AND UNITS. OpenXR LOCAL space is metres, +Y up, -Z the way the
-- head faced at session start. World space is world PIXELS, +Y up, +Z
-- south. The two are aligned axis-for-axis -- "away from you" is north --
-- so the whole mapping is one translate-and-scale:
--
--   worldFromXr(p) = pivot + s * (p - anchor)
--
-- with `pivot` a world point, `anchor` the LOCAL-space point pinned to it,
-- and `s` the scale in px/m. An eye's camera is then
--
--   worldFromEye = T(pivot) * S(s) * T(-anchor) * T(pose.pos) * R(pose.q)
--   view         = the same chain inverted piece by rigid piece
--
-- and the VIEW deliberately ends in METRES: it un-scales the world, so eye
-- space -- where the projection's near and far live -- is real-world
-- metres whatever the mode's scale. Depth precision and clip planes stay
-- sane at both 10 px/m and 128 px/m.

-- Where, in LOCAL metres, the diorama's pivot sits: VIEW_DIST away along
-- the RUNG'S OWN viewing angle. The flat screen's camera looks at the
-- world `a` radians off vertical; putting the pivot at (-d cos a) below
-- and (-d sin a) ahead of the resting head reproduces exactly that line
-- of sight -- step onto the 35 rung and the table presents at 35 degrees,
-- onto 75 and it rises toward eye level, easing between them as the rung
-- tween runs.
--
-- `off` is the grab-drag adjustment, in metres of LOCAL travel -- where
-- the player has carried the model to. A bare number is the height alone,
-- which is what the standard mode's one-axis drag has always sent; the
-- DIORAMA modes hand over all three (see lib/Diorama). Positive Y drags
-- the world up: the anchor is the LOCAL point pinned to the pivot, so
-- moving it moves the model with the hand rather than against it.

-- line the flat battle camera stands on (eye through focus, so the player's
-- mon is near-left and the foe far-right exactly as the flat shot frames
-- them), but pulled in to BATTLE_DIST -- the flat rig is a long lens from
-- fifteen metres back, and a headset's lens is its own eyes, so keeping the
-- distance would shrink the fight to a stage seen from the back row. 66 px
-- is the wide rig's own standing distance: six and a half metres at life

-- -- and short enough to stay inside the small rooms the wide rig exists
-- for.

-- Off by default because standing inside a bent world is what first person

-- the whole point rather than a broken tabletop -- and it is what the left
-- stick's click throws (see lib/VR). Passed in rather than read here
-- because a rig has no business deciding what a row means.
--
-- Beware the shape of the answer: Voxel3D reads `camera.curve` with `or`,

-- is exactly why the diorama's curve did nothing until this became a
