-- One of this mod's own settings: a ladder of values, where it persists,
-- and the row the player cycles it on.
--
-- The engine gives a render pipeline all of this for free -- ladder,
-- options row, hotkey, persistence -- but only to something that OWNS a
-- pass of the frame. The voxel wireframe and the world curve do not: they
-- parameterise the voxel pass, so they have nothing to put in drawWorld or
-- present and the registry rightly rejects them. What is left is a plain
-- mod setting, and this is the boilerplate two of them would otherwise
-- each carry a copy of:
--
--   options:define   a home in options.modOptions.DRAMATIC_SHAPE, plus a row
--                    on this mod's page in the mod manager.
--   ui.options.rows  the same setting on the OPTIONS menu, where the
--                    player already goes for VOXEL and T-SHIFT.
--
-- Both rows read and write the one stored value, so they cannot disagree.
-- Writing mirrors what the manager's own page does (ManagerState:setOption):
-- the live save's options table, the loader's copy that mod.options:get
-- reads, and then the file.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module

-- ------- rungs that are not always there
--
-- A ladder may carry a rung that cannot be selected right now -- STADIUM
-- needs models built out of a ROM the player supplies, and until that has
-- happened there is nothing behind the option. `gate` is asked per rung and
-- decides whether it exists at all this frame.
--
-- Skipped rather than shown-and-refused, deliberately. A row that can be
-- cycled onto and then does nothing is indistinguishable from a broken mod;
-- a row that simply has fewer stops reads as the mod not offering something,
-- which is the truth. What the player is missing, and how to get it, is said
-- once in the row's help text instead of implied by a dead setting.
--
-- values[1] is never gated: it is the default and the fallback, so there is
-- always at least one rung to land on.
