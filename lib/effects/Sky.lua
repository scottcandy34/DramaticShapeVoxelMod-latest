-- The sky, generated rather than shipped.
--
-- The overworld's, on every VOXEL rung. Wherever the diorama is drawn the void
-- behind it is sky rather than a black plate: at 75 degrees the horizon is
-- genuinely in frame and the bands run down to meet it, and at the steeper rungs
-- the void that shows is the ground running out past the map edge, which gets
-- the same sky above the same haze. A battle's placed camera keeps the flat fill
-- it has always had -- its horizon is above the frame and its look is not this
-- rung's to change.
--
-- THE RECIPE is the 8-bit skybox one: a short palette of blues painted as flat
-- horizontal bands, deepest overhead, with a CHECKERBOARD of the next band
-- dithered into the bottom of each one. Alternating two colours on a pixel grid
-- is how a machine with four colours to a palette got a fifth, sixth and seventh
-- out of them, and it is what keeps four bands reading as a gradient rather than
-- as four stripes. No clouds, nothing moving.
--
-- NOTHING IS RESAMPLED, which is the whole of why it is drawn this way. There is
-- no baked 160x144 picture scaled up to the window and no downsized buffer blown
-- back up: one full-region rectangle through a shader that answers every pixel
-- from its own canvas coordinate. A pixel of sky is computed at the size it is
-- displayed at, so there is nothing for a filter to soften and nothing to go
-- stale when the window or the zoom changes. The shader does bind one texture,
-- but it is a palette rather than an image -- the bands, one texel each, sampled
-- nearest (see rampFor, and why it is not a uniform array).
--
-- THE PIXEL GRID follows the zoom for the same reason. Bands and dither cells
-- are measured in DIORAMA pixels -- the pass's own pixels-per-world-pixel, handed
-- in fresh every frame -- so a chunky sky at 4x is a chunky sky at 12x, band
-- edges land on the same grid the world's own texels do, and a ZOOM keypress is
-- reflected in the frame that follows it rather than whenever something else
-- happened to rebuild.
--
-- PALETTE ORDER, which is easy to get wrong. Stored LIGHTEST FIRST, because that
-- is shade order: a display mode transforms a four-colour palette by replacing it
-- outright (PaletteFX.effectiveColors hands back GRAYS or CLASSIC), and those are
-- written light to dark. So the sky reads the list backwards -- deepest shade
-- overhead, shade 1 at the horizon -- and GRAY gets greys the right way up for
-- nothing.
--
-- WHAT TIME IT IS decides the colours. The palette itself lives in DayNight
-- (four phase palettes, blended along the clock and re-quantised to the
-- lattice), and this file paints whatever the clock says: blue at noon, gold
-- and violet through the twilights -- warmed further around the low sun by a
-- dithered GLOW -- and deep navy under the moon. The sun and moon themselves
-- hang here too: cell-art discs on the same grid as the dither, scissored to
-- the sky's own region so a setting body slips below the horizon point and is
-- gone, never wandering under the map.

Sky.MAX_BANDS = 8

-- The checkerboard between bands. DITHER_START is how far down a band it begins,
-- as a fraction of that band: lower is a wider blend, and 1 switches it off. 0.6
-- leaves the top of each band flat -- a band dithered all the way through reads
-- as one averaged colour instead of as a step with a soft bottom edge.
Sky.DITHER = true
Sky.DITHER_START = 0.6

-- How much of the frame the bands cover when the horizon is NOT in it, as a
-- fraction of the canvas height.
--
-- At the steeper rungs the camera looks down far enough that the ground plane's
-- vanishing line is above the top edge -- there is no horizon to hang the pale
-- end on, but there is still void up there where the map runs out, and it should
-- read as sky. So the bands take the same slice of the frame the top rung's own
-- horizon gives them, which keeps the sky looking like one sky across the whole
-- ladder instead of changing character rung by rung.
Sky.SPAN = 0.23

-- How much ELEVATION the gradient spans above the horizon, in radians, for
-- a caller that anchors the sky IN SPACE rather than to the frame (the VR

-- the top edge of the frame down to the horizon, which is right for a
-- camera whose pitch is the rung's: the frame IS the window on the sky.
-- A headset's frame is wherever the head points, so glueing the zenith
-- band to its top edge drags the whole gradient around with the head. An
-- anchored caller instead hangs the gradient over a fixed slice of sky --
-- horizon to ELEV_SPAN up -- and hands paint() the canvas row that span's
-- top lands on this frame (the `top` argument), so tilting the head slides
-- the frame across a sky that stays put.

-- which is what they used to be: `uniform vec3 bands[8]`, filled from Lua and
-- read through a loop counter. On desktop GL that is as portable as it looks.
-- On Android it was not. The sky's lower bands came back BLACK -- a hard-edged
-- strip running from partway down the gradient to the horizon point, with the
-- moon still drawn correctly over it, and with the haze BELOW the sky (the
-- palest band again, but delivered by love.graphics.clear instead of by the
-- array) landing in exactly the right colour. Same colour, two routes, one of
-- them black: the fault was the array, not the palette.
--
-- Which of the ES failure modes it was hardly matters -- a driver that
-- truncates a partially-filled array, a fragment uniform budget the guaranteed
-- floor of which is sixteen vectors (eight bands plus the glow plus LOVE's own
-- built-ins is over it), a reflection that finds bands[0] and nothing after --
-- because they all have the same shape: slots past the first few read as zero,
-- and zero is black.
--
-- A sampler has none of them. One texture unit replaces eight uniform vectors,
-- there is no array to index and no budget to overrun, and a texel that does
-- not exist cannot read as black because the image is built at exactly the
-- width the shader divides by. Nearest and clamped, so a sample lands on one
-- band's own colour and an out-of-range one lands on the end band rather than
-- on nothing.

-- mode does; Sky.bands drops it as it rebuilds the list it is made from.

-- the caller's own camera (Voxel3D.skyBody), with the twilight glow riding
-- along; nil hangs nothing and warms nothing.
--
-- `top` anchors the gradient in space rather than to the frame: the canvas
-- row band 1 starts on (often negative -- above the frame), from a caller
-- that mapped a fixed elevation span to its own camera (see ELEV_SPAN).
-- nil or 0 is the flat screen's behaviour: zenith band at the top edge.

-- {ax, ay} pointing "toward the ground" on the canvas (Voxel3D.horizonLine),

-- rows. nil is the level default. Only the shader path can tilt; the flat
-- fallback paints level, which only a headless run ever sees. Under an
-- axis the DISC is not painted here at all -- the VR caller hangs the
-- baked disc (Sky.discImage) in the world instead; `body` still carries
-- the twilight glow into the bands.
--
-- `ray` makes the gradient a SKYBOX: the eye's own ray fan (the camera
-- record's skyRay, from VRRig.eyeCamera), letting every pixel take its
-- band from its TRUE elevation -- so no motion of the head, on any axis,
-- moves a band; only the clock does. nil keeps the linear frame gradient
-- the flat screen has always painted.

-- fill is the whole sky. That fill is the palest band, so a frame that declines
-- this looks like a hazy day rather than like a bug.
