-- Voxel world mode: a building voxelized from its own sprite.
--
-- A Game Boy overworld building is a fake-3D projection that packs several
-- different 3D facings into one flat drawing: the roof is drawn as if seen
-- from above, the facade as if seen face-on, and the sloped ends as
-- diagonal silhouettes. Raising the whole footprint as one box (what the
-- generic volume path does) folds all three into a wall, so a house comes
-- out as a cube wearing its own elevation.
--
-- This module does the other thing: it classifies each BAND of the drawing
-- by the surface it depicts and applies the matching operation per band --
-- the pipeline written up in assets/docs/buidling_to_voxel/. Two rules govern it:
--
--   1. Every visible voxel colour is a real texel of the drawing. Nothing
--      is invented but the geometry the sprite implies and never paints
--      (undersides, the depth behind the facade), and those wear the
--      drawing's own four shades.
--   2. The sprite is ground truth, not the tile grid. The silhouette, the
--      taper rate, the eave height and every window are MEASURED off the
--      pixels; the profile only says which rows are roof and which are
--      facade.
--
-- The pipeline, per template (see data/voxel_heights.lua `buildings`):
--
--   read     composite the building out of the atlas and flood its
--            silhouette in from the border through light pixels only --
--            the black outline and the #555 shading together are the
--            boundary, and a "not black" test eats the shaded flanks.
--   measure  the topmost drawn row of each column IS the roof's elevation
--            profile (the drawn taper is the slope); the facade's panes
--            are the non-black regions its black frames seal off.
--   build    facade rows extrude straight back over the footprint, the
--            awning band juts past them, panes sink one voxel, and the
--            roof lays the top-facing rows flat -- level over the
--            plateau, stepping down the drawn taper at the ends -- then
--            overwrites the walls it intersects.
--   emit     cull to the shell and merge runs of texel-adjacent faces into
--            single quads, so a 90k-voxel house ships as ~2k quads.
--
-- One model is built per template and stamped at every placement: Red's
-- and Blue's houses are the same seven-placement drawing, so they cost one
-- build between them. mods/DRAMATIC_SHAPE/tools/building_voxels.py is the
-- reference implementation of the same algorithm and prints the voxel and
-- shell counts this one must agree with.
--
-- Purely presentational, like everything else in the mod: the tiles a
-- building claims keep the collision, warps and triggers they always had.

-- ------- how far a merged run may reach: the tile lattice
--
-- Merging is what keeps a 90k-voxel house down to ~2k quads, and under a
-- straight projection a run may be as long as it likes -- a straight line
-- is a straight line however finely it is cut. THE WORLD CURVE IS NOT
-- STRAIGHT. It drops every vertex by the square of its distance from the
-- focus (see WorldCurve), so a quad's interior is the CHORD of a parabola
-- its neighbours draw the arc of: a run of length L hangs k*L^2/4 below
-- the short quads butted against it, and the join tears open.
--
-- Nothing bounded a run's length before, and the runs that ran away were
-- the ones wearing a CONSTANT texel -- the roof's black eave outline, its
-- fascia, the shaded underside -- because a flat run has no art to break
-- it. Those reached 102px across a gym, which at V-CURVE 3 hangs some
-- three world pixels under the roof surface beside it: the eave tore off
-- the roof and the drop showed the building's dark interior through the
-- slot. (Strip runs, the drawing marching along the atlas, break at the
-- tileset's own boundaries and were never the problem.)
--
-- So a run stops at the next 8px lattice line. Buildings are stamped at
-- tx*8 (see stamp), so the model's lattice IS the map's: every quad in the
-- scene -- terrain, props, this -- now ends on the same lines, every join
-- is vertex-for-vertex, and the bend carries them together. What is left
-- is the sag WITHIN one cell, k*64/4, which is under a twentieth of a
-- world pixel at any rung.
--
-- It costs quads on a dense city map (Cerulean's object stream goes from
-- 35.7k to 41.6k, and its longest edge from 102px to 8px) and it costs them
-- whether the curve is on or not, which is the deliberate trade: the mesh
-- is cached per map and built asynchronously over seconds, so meshing for
-- the curve's sake only when the curve is on would mean rebuilding every
-- live map on a keypress.

-- it -- the drawing straddles the LAVENDER_TOWN / ROUTE_10 boundary, its
-- roof band and top window courses standing in the route's last rows, so
-- no single map's grid holds the whole building. The matcher never sees
-- topRows (placement is still by `tiles` alone); they exist so the MODEL
-- is built from the complete drawing and the tower rises to its real
-- height instead of folding as two half-buildings.
-- Composite one doorway cell PAST the end of the sprite, at indices
-- W*H .. W*H+255, and hand back its base. The side-door pass paints with
-- sprite indices like everything else -- `emit` resolves a voxel's colour
-- through sp.ax/sp.ay and knows nothing about where the index came from --
-- so the door only has to BE in the sprite arrays to travel the rest of
-- the pipeline untouched. Appending rather than drawing into the grid is
-- the point: the drawing itself must not change, or the silhouette flood,
-- the taper and every measured band would be read off art the tileset
-- never placed here.
--
-- Nothing else walks past W*H (measure's shadeTexel scan and the pane
-- flood both stop there), so the block is invisible to measurement and
-- visible only to the code that asks for it by index.
--
-- WHICH OF THE 256 TEXELS ARE THE DOOR. A doorway cell is not a doorway
-- edge to edge: the tileset draws it as a cell OF A FACADE, so its outer
-- ring is the wall beside and above the frame, and its last row is the
-- black threshold the building stands on with the door's own step cut into
-- it. Painting all 16x16 onto a flank would stamp a one-pixel border of
-- front-wall art around every door.
--
-- The front facade tells the ring from the door by flooding: the wall
-- around the door is one region with the whole facade, far too big to be a
-- pane, and only what the black frame SEALS sinks. The same test, bounded
-- to the block: flood the left, right and top edges through their own
-- shade class, and what the flood reaches is context -- left unpainted, so
-- the flank keeps the texel it already had. Not the bottom edge, because
-- the bottom edge is the ground: the step under the door is sealed there
-- on the drawn facade too, and it recesses with the rest of the doorway.
--
-- What is painted then splits the way a facade's does: black is frame and
-- stays flush with the wall, everything it seals sinks a voxel behind it.

--     already.
--   the cell is not already a door tile -- a south entrance IS drawn, as a
--     doorway block in the facade, and lib/Structures.lua folds it up into
--     the front face. Adding a second one there would fight it.
--   the cell is WALKABLE -- the ROM gives an unreachable twin warp to
--     several gates (a fence cell beside the real opening on Route 7 west
--     and Route 16 east, a tree beside Route 6's), and a door on the wall
--     behind a fence is a door into nothing. The reachable cells are the
