-- Voxel world mode: detect the map's structures and pick a 3D model for
-- each -- the 3dSen idea applied to a tile map. 3dSen turns flat NES
-- scenes into 3D by classifying every graphic into a geometry archetype
-- (floor, wall, box, voxelized sprite) and building real geometry that
-- keeps the original art as its texture; this module does the same with
-- the map's tile layer as the scene description:
--
--   1. Flood-fill every connected region of solid (upright, unauthored)
--      tiles -- a house with its mailbox, the potted plant, a fence row,
--      a stretch of border forest.
--
--   2. Decide which pixels of the region's art are BACKGROUND. Tileset
--      art carries no alpha and white is a paint color (window frames,
--      wall stripes), so whiteness alone says nothing. The map does: the
--      background is the white that CONNECTS TO WALKABLE GROUND in the
--      assembled scene. Seeding a flood from the surrounding ground
--      eats the air around a fence post or a plant's leaves but cannot
--      reach an interior wall's white stripes sealed behind its dark
--      trim -- exactly the distinction a human reads.
--
--   3. Tiles whose art turned out mostly background are SPRITE-LIKE;
--      their connected clusters become per-pixel voxel OBJECTS at the
--      art's real drawn height (a 2-row plant is a 16px silhouette, a
--      fence a row of true posts with air between), thin voxel depth,
--      standing on synthesized ground. This splits mixed regions: the
--      mailbox voxelizes even where it touches the house.
--
--   4. Everything else becomes a VOLUME: each column rises to the height
--      the structure is actually DRAWN. A column's run gives its extent,
--      repetition caps it -- the border forest repeats a 2-row canopy
--      for forty rows and must be rows of 16px trees, not a monolith --
--      and columns answer to their region: the column above a doorway
--      repeats internally but adopts its 48px house. The south face
--      folds the artwork up (ChunkMesher's band rule).
--
-- data/voxel_heights.lua is the PROFILE over this: a tile authored there
-- (ledges, or a mod pinning a shape) bypasses detection entirely, the way
-- a 3dSen game profile pins a pattern to a geometry type.
--
-- Everything here is derived per map and cached; pixel access (object
-- voxelization, void detection) degrades gracefully headless -- regions
-- simply stay volumes and the geometry tests keep passing.

-- ---- round scenery: outline-hulled voxel balls ----

-- Cells the profile pins as round (tree canopies -- the class keeps its
-- historical `cylinder` name in the data file) render as a VOXEL HULL cut
-- from the drawing itself. The first shipped attempt was a lathe -- the
-- per-row silhouette width revolved into a 12-segment column with the art
-- wrapped by sin(angle) -- and it read exactly like what it was: the
-- sprite pasted on a cylinder, with the wrap smearing the pixels into
-- vertical stripes. This replaces it with real voxels.
--
-- Segmentation first, silhouette-width second: the tree cell's art is a
-- ball drawn over background grass, and the background's mid greens pass
-- any brightness test (they inflated every lathe row to full width). The
-- ball's own DARKEST pixels are what bound it, so the mask is "the
-- darkest-shade outline plus everything it encloses": flood from the cell
-- border through every non-black pixel; what the flood cannot reach is
-- the tree, and the cast shadow under the canopy (dark but not enclosed)
-- floods away with the grass. Art with no closed black outline -- the
-- border tree wall is a dither of black and canopy with no drawn ring --
-- encloses nothing; there the flood passes only through the LIGHT shades
-- (the methodology doc's rule: black and dark together form the
-- boundary), and the dither mass itself becomes the mask, checker holes
-- and all, because a 4-connected flood cannot thread a diagonal checker.
--
-- Volume: each mask row is a disc. The row's span gives a center and
-- half-width, and every mask pixel's column runs that circle's chord in
-- z, quantized to whole voxels -- the front view IS the sprite, the plan
-- view is the sprite's own width profile turned in depth, and both step
-- pixel by pixel. Rows below the mask (the drawn shadow) repeat the
-- bottom row's discs down to the ground so the canopy stands on a short
-- dark foot instead of floating.
--
-- Skin: front and back faces carry the drawing per-pixel (the back reads
-- mirrored, sprite-pure); side and step faces take their column's own
-- texel, which puts the drawn outline exactly on the silhouette's rim;
-- and a fully exposed cap keeps its outline only on the rim cells while
-- the interior samples the canopy a couple of rows deeper -- painting the
-- whole cap with the outline row blacked out every dome on the first
-- attempt (the lathe hit the same bug with its top discs).
--
-- Tree walls repeat the same four tiles for hundreds of cells, so the
-- hull is built once per distinct art signature and stamped per cell.

-- interior plant already uses.
--
-- `rows` = 24 puts the slab/revolve boundary AT THE VESSEL'S RIM ROW, and
-- that placement is what makes the pot read as a pot. The first cut put
-- it at the cell seam (16), which let the root and drape rows revolve:
-- their drawn spans are 8-12 wide, so they stacked 8-12-deep discs on top
-- of the rim and the whole base read as one bulbous onion instead of a

-- something when the drawing states a width to turn -- the pot's rows do
-- (a 3px stem opening to a 12px belly and closing to a 6px foot, an urn's
-- profile), and a tree canopy's do (the ball's outline is drawn). A leaf
-- crown's do NOT: the leaves are a spray that runs off all four sides of
-- its tile, so every row measures the full canvas and the revolve can only
-- produce a solid cylinder -- the "hedge column" a plant must never become,
-- with one row of texels smeared down its whole top face. Where the drawing
-- states no profile, the honest reading is the one the thin standee pools
-- exist for: the foliage stands as a per-pixel slab and keeps the airy
-- silhouette that makes it read as leaves.
-- `squash`, when given, is the PERCENT of its revolved depth every chord
-- keeps -- 100 (or nil) is the identity, 50 halves the hull front to back.
--
-- A full revolve assumes the drawing's width is also its depth, which is
-- true of a thing that really is round in plan (a hedge ball, a boulder,
-- a trash can). A TREE is round in its canopy and thin at every other
-- reading: the trunk is a stick, the crown is more air than wood, and the
-- drawing is scenery seen from one side. Revolved at full width the little
-- tree eats a whole cell of depth and reads as a boulder wearing bark, so
-- the plan stays a circle and shrinks toward an ellipse: still round in
-- section, still stepping pixel by pixel, just shallower. The chord is
-- re-centred on the mid-plane, so the model neither slides nor detaches
-- from the cells around it.

  -- The Centers' steps state their own band table and it lands exactly:
  -- 4 white rows, 1 black, 3 grey, 1 black, 3 checker, 4 black = 16.  So
  -- an even four-step division puts a black NOSING on the southmost row of
  -- every band (15, 11, 7, 3) and leaves the rows behind it as that step's
  -- tread.  Nothing is authored but the RISE, which no head-on drawing can
  -- state; the depths, the treads and the nosings are all measured.
  --
  -- A nosing is drawn as one row because it is seen nearly edge-on, so
  -- un-projected it has real height and no depth: its row lies flat as the
  -- tread's front lip AND stands as the riser under it.  That is the one
  -- texel in the flight used twice, and using it twice is what a nosing is.
  --
  -- The well's own walls come free as well: the drawing's first and last
  -- COLUMNS are its black side walls, and its top band is the darkness the
  -- flight leaves by, which is what the far end wants to wear.
  --
  -- A flight CLIMBING away (`stair_n`) is the same reading with the sign of
  -- the rise flipped -- bands still run south to north, drawn row is still
  -- depth row, the nosing still serves twice.  Two things follow from the
  -- sign.  The risers turn around: a flight descending away from you closes
  -- its steps from below and shows you their backs, one climbing away shows
  -- you their FRONTS, so they face south.  And the drawing's black side
  -- columns stop being a well's walls and become the walls of the opening
  -- the flight climbs into: they run from each tread UP to the top of the
  -- wall band rather than down from the floor.  At the last step the flight
  -- has reached that top and there is no opening left to wall.
  --
  -- Every quad here is split at the cell's own 8px seam, in x and in rows
  -- both: `uv` resolves ONE tile per corner, and these four tiles are not
  -- neighbours in the atlas, so a quad that spans a seam interpolates
  -- between two unrelated corners of the sheet.

-- the treatment every solid standee in this file gets, driven by a hand
-- drawn silhouette instead of a flood.
--
-- The caller owns placement entirely, because placement is the whole
-- difference between the two things that use this: `x0` is the world x of
-- the mask's west edge, `yOf(ly)` the world y a drawn row lands at, and
-- `bandOf(ly)` its z span.  A bicycle hung on a wall keeps its drawn
-- elevation and juts south of the band; a cash register stands on the
-- counter's top plane and sits inside its own cell.
--
-- `bandOf` is per ROW rather than per object so one drawing can hold parts
-- of different thickness (the register's receipt curl over its body).
-- Where the band CHANGES between two stacked rows the lower row still gets
-- its top face: without that the body would be open along the strip the
-- thinner part does not cover, and you would see into the machine.
--
-- `omit` is a rect of the mask this pass does NOT extrude, because it is
-- not a face at all -- maskPlate lays it flat instead.  It leaves the mask
-- for good here, neighbours included, so the extrusion closes up around
-- the notch exactly as if the drawing had never filled it.

-- The other half of the same drawing: a rect of the mask that is a
-- TOP-VIEW surface, laid HORIZONTAL instead of extruded.
--
-- This is the methodology's band classification at rect granularity, and
-- the reason the register is not a box.  A GB cell packs several facings,
-- and the register's keypad is drawn from ABOVE -- its keys lie on the
-- machine's deck, sealed behind their own black border inside the outer
-- silhouette.  Extruding it stands that surface on end and paints the keys
-- up the machine's face, which is the extruded-picture failure exactly.
--
-- So the rect lands one voxel proud of what maskSlab left below it, at `y`,
-- one voxel thick, filling the body's whole depth band (`z0`, `D`).
--
-- The rect STRETCHES over that band rather than laying its rows 1:1: it is
-- the machine's whole deck, so it has to reach the machine's whole depth,
-- and the alternative -- panel at the front, bare deck behind -- leaves a
-- strip of the base band's top showing through where the keys should be.
-- Sampled at the voxel's CENTRE, the same rule Stage 1 samples the atlas
-- with, so a band scales by whole voxels and nothing blurs: at 8 rows over
-- 12 voxels every second drawn row doubles.  The one place in the model
-- where a texel is not 1:1 with a drawn pixel, and the reason `depth` is an
-- authored number again.  No bottom faces: it rests on the box.

-- ---- figures: a thing drawn INTO furniture, cut out and stood up ----

-- One authored figure at one matched position.
--
-- The mask IS the classification: no flood, no shade segmentation, no
-- validation gate.  Every automatic route in this file asks the art where
-- the object ends, and a figure painted into its own furniture has no
-- answer to give -- so the profile answers instead, and this only has to
-- believe it.  Which also means figures build HEADLESS: unlike every
-- other standee here, nothing below reads a pixel.
--
-- A PERSON is a SPRITE, not a prop, and an entry that states no `depth`
-- gets exactly the treatment SpriteBillboards gives a character: one flat
-- plane of the drawing's own pixels, no thickness, standing at its feet
-- and leaned back by the camera's pitch at draw time so it always reads
-- face-on -- because that is what the artwork is.  A seated man drawn
-- face-on is a 2D icon like every other Gen 1 figure; extruding him into
-- a slab reconstructs a body nobody drew (the ten-voxel version read as a
-- wedge of furniture, and even one voxel showed an edge the sprites never
-- show).
--
-- So the card's quads are emitted in its OWN LOCAL SPACE -- x from the
-- mask's west edge, y from his feet, all at z = 0 -- and the placement
-- (`wx`, `wz`, `y`) rides along for VoxelScene to build the lean matrix
-- from.  One quad per pixel rather than one alpha-keyed texture: the
-- tileset atlas has no alpha to key on, and per-pixel quads cut the exact
-- same silhouette straight out of the live atlas, so every palette bake
-- (SGB, RED++ per-tile groups, a mod's own art) textures him for free.
--
-- An entry that DOES state a `depth` is not a person, and takes the other
-- branch: a per-pixel voxel slab in world space (maskSlab above), standing
-- on the same furniture the card would have stood on.  The Marts' cash
-- register is why -- a machine set down on a counter is a box seen from
-- the front, and a card of it is the billboard failure the standee pools
-- exist to avoid.  It keeps the card's anchoring exactly: its feet on the
-- support's top plane, and its body in the 8px depth band of the tile row
-- its lowest pixel is drawn in, which is where a character card would
-- have pivoted.  So the machine sits at the FRONT of the counter cell it
-- is drawn low in, and never leans into the aisle behind it.

--

-- because a drawing painted onto the wall it hangs on has no background
-- margin for a flood to enter by, and here the wall's own #555 stripes
-- are a flood boundary as well, so a silhouette comes back striped.
-- Like a figure it therefore builds HEADLESS: nothing below reads a
-- pixel.
--
-- But a mounted object is an OBJECT, so it is built the way every other
-- standee here is -- a per-pixel voxel slab wearing the drawing's own
-- texels, quads emitted in world space -- and not as a sprite card:
--
--   ELEVATION is the drawn one.  A figure stands on its own feet; this
--   keeps the row it is painted in, because the band it is painted into
--   is a measured 16px face rising off the floor.  So drawn row `ly`
--   becomes world y = (band height - 1) - ly, and a bicycle whose wheels
--   are drawn on the band's bottom row lands on the floor while one hung
--   clear of it stays hung.
--   DEPTH juts SOUTH of the band's own face (z0 at the drawing's south
--   edge), so the object stands in front of the wall rather than inside
--   it.  It overhangs the walkable cell in front, which is what a bicycle

-- ---- tall grass ----

-- ---- closing a standee's sides ----
--
-- The grass tufts and the flowers are both built the same way: each row of
-- the 8x8 drawing becomes a horizontal RUN of lit pixels, stood up as a
-- front face and a back face one voxel apart, with a lid on top. What that
-- leaves open is the two ENDS of every run -- so the slab was a pair of
-- billboards rather than a solid, and from any angle off square you looked
-- in through the edge and straight out the other side. At the low cameras
-- this mod has grown (1ST, 3RD, the battle's floor-level seat) that is
-- most of the time.
--
-- A wall goes on an end only where the pixel beyond it is actually clear,
-- which for a run's end it is by construction -- except where two runs on
-- the same row meet across a gap of nothing, which cannot happen, and at
-- the tile's border, where the neighbouring tile's own standee may or may
-- not continue the shape. The border is closed anyway: tufts sit on their
-- own half-cells with a gap between them, so an open border edge is a hole
-- in the open, not a seam with anything.
--
-- Each wall samples ONE texel at its centre -- the end pixel it is closing
-- off -- so it wears that pixel's own colour, which is the nearest coloured
-- pixel to the surface being filled. Sampling a single texel is also what
-- carries the animation: when a frame keys that pixel out, the wall's own
-- fragments discard with the faces either side of it, so a swaying tuft
-- never leaves a wall standing where its blade no longer is.
-- `everyPixel` is for a standee whose silhouette ANIMATES. The mesh is
-- built once, over the UNION of every frame's mask, and each frame is cut
-- out again in texture space -- so a run that is six pixels wide in the
-- union may be two pixels wide in the frame on screen, and the four pixels
-- that dropped out took the union's end walls with them. What is left
-- exposed is an interior boundary, which had no wall because in the union
-- it was not a boundary at all. That is the gap that survived closing the
-- run ends: the first frame looked solid and every other frame did not.
--
-- So an animated standee gets a wall on BOTH sides of EVERY pixel. A wall
-- between two lit pixels is enclosed by the front and back faces and never
-- seen; the moment its neighbour is keyed out it becomes the edge, already
-- in place and already wearing the right colour. Each is inset a hair into
-- its own pixel so the two that meet at a boundary are not coplanar -- the
-- voxel pass draws with culling off, and two quads in the same plane would
-- z-fight rather than politely take turns.

-- did. Transparency respected: only the tuft strokes stand. Runs of
-- adjacent pixels merge into single quads, and one template per grass
-- tile id is stamped across the map (grass comes in fields).

-- clean in half -- the two halves ended up 4px tall and 4px apart in

        -- A flower SWAYS: the geometry spans the union of every animation
        -- frame's mask and each frame is cut back out of it in texture
        -- space (see the header). So "is there a pixel next door" has two
        -- different answers -- one in the union this mesh was built from,
        -- and one in the frame actually on screen -- and only the second
        -- decides what is exposed.
        --
        -- Closing the union's own edges is therefore not enough, and was
        -- the bug the first cut of this shipped: the base frame looked
        -- solid and every other frame still had gaps, because a pixel that
        -- drops out of a frame takes the union's wall with it and leaves an
        -- interior boundary that never had one.
        --
        -- So every pixel gets a cap on all four of its remaining faces,
        -- whatever its neighbours do. A cap between two lit pixels sits
        -- inside the slab, enclosed by the front and back faces, and is
        -- never seen; the moment its neighbour is keyed out it IS the edge,
        -- already there and already wearing the right colour. Each samples
        -- its own pixel's texel, so it appears and vanishes with the pixel
        -- it belongs to rather than with the one it is closing off.
        --
        -- Inset a hair into its own pixel, because the voxel pass draws
        -- with culling off: the two caps that meet at a boundary would be
        -- coplanar and z-fight rather than politely take turns.
