-- Voxel world mode: water, and what it reflects.
--
-- Every other surface in this mode is opaque and is drawn once, inside the
-- terrain mesh, by the scene shader. Water is neither: it is a MIRROR, and
-- a mirror cannot be drawn until the thing it reflects already exists. So
-- the water surface is lifted out of the terrain mesh at build time
-- (ChunkMesher's water sink) and drawn as its own pass, after the world and
-- before the characters, by the shader below.
--
-- WHAT IT REFLECTS, in the order the shader resolves them:
--
--   the sky      the reflected direction is put through the SAME matrix the
--                frame is drawn with, as a point at infinity, and the canvas
--                row that lands on is looked up on Sky's own band ramp --
--                the identical texture, dither and display-mode transform
--                the painted sky uses. So the sky in the lake is the sky
--                over it: blue at noon, gold at dusk, navy under the moon,
--                and it meets the painted sky at the waterline with no seam.
--
--   the sun,     hung by ANGLE rather than by screen position, because a
--   the moon     reflected body is usually off the top of the frame and a
--                projected point is meaningless out there. The angular
--                radius is Sky.discRadius converted through the camera's own
--                field of view, so the disc on the water is exactly as big
--                as the disc in the sky -- craters, dithered rim, the
--                sunset's loom and all. This is also the specular: a low sun
--                lays a broken gold path across the water on its own, out of
--                the reflection rather than out of a highlight term.
--
--   the world    SCREEN SPACE. The reflected ray is walked forward in world
--                space, each step projected through the same matrix, looking
--                for where it passes behind what the depth buffer holds --
--                then binary-refined onto the contact and read out of a copy
--                of the frame as it stood before the water went down. Shore
--                trees, buildings, ledges and cliffs land in the water
--                because they are on screen; where the ray leaves the frame
--                or finds nothing, the sky above answers instead, which is
--                what makes the far half of a lake sky and the near half
--                scenery without a seam between them.
--
--   the cast     the walkers, the NPCs, the authored figures and a staged
--                battle's two Pokemon. Awkward, and settled by drawing them
--                twice: Gen 1 draws people OVER the world and water is
--                world, so a surfing player has to composite after the
--                water, and a reflection can only hold what came before it.
--                So they are painted into the reflection copy alone
--                (Voxel3D.beginWater), in the picture the water reflects and
--                not yet in the picture it is drawn into.
--
-- WHAT IT CANNOT REFLECT is what no screen-space reflection can: anything
-- that is not in the frame. A tree just off the top edge is not in the water
-- below it, and a ray that runs off the side of the screen fades into the
-- sky rather than ending on a line.
--
-- THE SURFACE ITSELF is not flat. It is a heightfield of one-world-pixel
-- columns, each standing a whole number of pixels tall and rising and
-- falling as waves, walked by the view ray in the pixel shader -- so the
-- bars occlude each other and show their sides without a single extra
-- vertex. See WAVE_HEIGHT and relief().
--
-- THE PASS ITSELF, and why it is shaped this way. The scene canvas carries a
-- READABLE depth canvas (Voxel3D), and a texture cannot be sampled while it
-- is bound as a render target -- so for the length of this pass the depth
-- buffer is DETACHED and the shader does the depth test itself, comparing
-- its own fragment depth against the texture it just stopped writing to.
-- That is the same test the hardware would have run, so a tree in front of a
-- pond still hides it; what it costs is depth WRITES, which water has no use
-- for anyway (it is flat, it never overlaps itself, and everything drawn
-- after it stands on top of it by construction).
--
-- Falls back all the way down. No readable depth canvas, a driver that will
-- not compile this, or the row set to OFF and the water mesh is simply drawn
-- by the ordinary scene shader -- flat animated water, exactly what the mode
-- drew before any of this existed.

-- ------- the row
--
-- Three rungs rather than a toggle, because the two halves of this cost
-- very different things. SKY is a handful of instructions per water pixel
-- and no extra buffers read; FULL adds the screen-space march, which is the
-- part that samples a depth texture twenty-odd times. A phone that wants the
-- sunset on the lake but not the ray march has somewhere to stand.

end

-- ------- the look, in constants
--
-- FRESNEL. Water reflects almost nothing looked straight down at and almost
-- everything looked along, which is Schlick's curve -- and taken literally
-- it hands the top rung a mirror and the other four nothing at all. This
-- mode's rungs are named for the camera's tilt off VERTICAL, so 15 is a
-- near-overhead camera meeting the water at 15 degrees off its normal:
-- honest Schlick gives that about 2%, and even a generous floor of 0.14 was
-- invisible.
--
-- So the floor is lifted a long way above water's true 0.04 and the exponent
-- softened from 5 to 2: the SHAPE is still the honest one -- a low camera
-- still gets much more of it than a high one -- but the bottom of the curve
-- is a pond rather than a painted tile.
Water.FRESNEL_FLOOR = 0.34
Water.FRESNEL_CEIL = 0.92
Water.FRESNEL_POWER = 2.0

-- THE HORIZON LEAN, which is the other half of why the steeper rungs showed
-- nothing -- and the bigger half.
--
-- A reflection off flat water points as far ABOVE the horizon as the eye is
-- above the water. At the top rung that is 15 degrees: the reflected ray
-- grazes the sky's pale end, sweeps the sun's own path and travels far
-- enough across the screen for the march to find the shoreline. At the 15
-- rung it is 75 degrees -- straight up. Up there the sky's bands are at
-- their DARKEST (deep blue over blue water, which is no picture at all), the
-- sun and moon sit at about 6 degrees of squashed elevation and are nowhere
-- near it, and the screen-space ray leaves the top of the frame in two
-- steps. All three of those are correct, and together they are a lake with
-- nothing in it.
--
-- So the reflected direction LEANS toward the way this camera is looking, by
-- however far the camera is from having a horizon in frame. That is a
-- deliberate stylisation and it is worth being exact about what it costs and
-- what it does not:
--
--   at the rung where the horizon IS in frame the lean is ZERO, so the one
--   place the join can actually be seen -- the waterline, where the lake
--   meets the painted sky -- is still the exact reflection it was.
--
--   at the rungs where the horizon is above the top edge there is no join to
--   break, and what the lean buys is the whole of the effect: the pale bands,
--   the sunset, the moon's path, and a screen-space ray that travels ACROSS
--   the diorama instead of straight out of it.
--
-- It leans toward an ELEVATION rather than by a weight, and that matters.
-- Mixing the ray a fixed fraction of the way toward horizontal sounds like
-- the same thing and is not: the ray it starts from is different at every
-- rung, so a fixed fraction lands them all somewhere different, and the
-- middle rungs came out worst of all -- further from the sun than the
-- steepest one. Aimed at an elevation, every rung below the top one puts its
-- reflection where the TOP rung puts its own, which is the one place the
-- effect is known to work.
--
-- Measured off Voxel3D.descent -- the sine of how far below horizontal the
-- view runs -- so it answers for the battle's placed camera too, which has
-- no rung to be asked about.
Water.LEAN_FROM = 0.30         -- descent where the lean starts: the top rung's
Water.LEAN_FULL = 0.55         -- and where it is complete
-- the elevation it aims at: the one the top rung's own reflection sits at,
-- stated as that same descent so the two cannot drift apart
Water.LEAN_ELEV = math.asin(Water.LEAN_FROM)

function Water.lean(descent)
  local span = Water.LEAN_FULL - Water.LEAN_FROM
  local t = ((descent or 0) - Water.LEAN_FROM) / span
  if t <= 0 then return 0 end
  return t < 1 and t or 1
end

-- ------- the waves
--
-- Not a normal map. The surface is a HEIGHTFIELD of one-world-pixel columns
-- -- the same unit every other voxel in this mode is built from, and exactly
-- one texel of the water tile (a tile is 8 texels across 8 world pixels) --
-- and every column stands at a whole number of pixels. So the water is a
-- field of little square bars rising and falling on their own, which is what
-- water made of pixels should look like from a camera that can see it in 3D.
--
-- It is drawn without any extra geometry. The mesh is still one flat quad
-- per tile; the columns are found by walking the view ray down through the
-- slab in the pixel shader (relief mapping) and taking the first one it
-- meets. That is what makes them read as SOLID rather than as shading: a
-- tall bar hides the shorter ones behind it, you see the SIDE of the ones
-- facing you, and the whole field parallaxes against the plane as the camera
-- moves. The side faces wear the mesh's own direction shading
-- (Voxel3D.FACE_SHADE, sent in rather than restated) so a wave crest is lit
-- like every other voxel in the world.
--
-- HEIGHT is in world pixels: the tallest a column may stand above the plane
-- the quad is drawn on, and so both the amplitude and the number of rungs a
-- crest can climb through (five gives six).
--
-- It is well past the 2px recess TileShape sinks water into, which is a
-- deliberate look rather than an oversight: the crests are RELIEF, drawn
-- inside the water quad's own screen footprint, so a bar that reaches above
-- the shoreline cannot actually spill over the bank -- it is clipped at the
-- water's edge like everything else this pass draws. What it buys is a
-- surface with real swell in it instead of a two-rung terrace.
Water.WAVE_HEIGHT = 5

-- ------- the trains
--
-- Each is { fx, fz, speed, weight }. The vector is the train's DIRECTION and
-- its frequency in one -- the crest runs across it, and two pi over its
-- length is the wavelength in world pixels -- and `speed` is what walks it.
--
-- The first one dominates, and that weighting is the whole difference
-- between water and soup: a wave has a direction, and its crest is a line
-- running across it for as far as the surface goes. Three trains of equal
-- weight cancel and reinforce in patches instead, and the field comes out as
-- round islands of raised pixels with no travel to them.
--
-- Long, too: the dominant wavelength is about forty world pixels, five
-- tiles, so a crest is a run of hundreds of columns at one height with a
-- step down either side. Pitched anywhere near a pixel they stop being waves
-- and become static -- every column its own island.
--
-- Read into the shader source rather than sent as uniforms, so the rate
-- below can be derived from the same numbers the field is built out of.
Water.WAVE_TRAINS = {
  { 0.150, 0.062, 1.60, 0.60 },
  { 0.058, 0.132, -1.05, 0.29 },
  { -0.041, 0.033, 0.55, 0.11 },
}

-- ------- and what keeps them from reading as one pattern
--
-- Three fixed trains are still an exactly periodic field: every forty-odd
-- pixels of sea wears the same crest at the same height, and a lake's worth
-- of that reads as wallpaper. Real swell varies two ways a sum of sines
-- cannot: waves arrive in SETS -- a few tall ones, then a lull -- and a
-- crest line curves as it runs rather than ruling itself across the whole
-- surface. Both are put back with one long-wavelength field each, riding
-- the DOMINANT train only; the two lesser trains stay plain, because they
-- are texture rather than structure and three modulators is soup again.
--
-- Both wear the trains' own shape, { fx, fz, speed, x }: a direction whose
-- length is the spatial frequency, a phase rate, and what the field does.
-- Their wavelengths sit four to five times the carrier's, far enough apart
-- that neither reads as a wave itself -- the swell as slow weather over the
-- crests, the bend as the crests' own drift.
--
-- THE SWELL scales the dominant train's amplitude; `x` is the DEPTH of the
-- deepest lull, as the fraction of the train it takes away. It runs roughly
-- along the carrier's own direction and slower than it, which is a wave
-- group's honest habit (deep-water groups travel at about half the phase
-- speed) -- so sets of crests swell up, march a while, and hand over to a
-- calm patch that is itself moving.
Water.WAVE_SWELL = { 0.0325, 0.0134, 0.55, 0.35 }

-- THE BEND adds a slow wobble to the dominant train's phase; `x` is the
-- wobble's reach in RADIANS of carrier phase. 1.1 radians against a carrier
-- of about forty pixels bows a crest some seven pixels off its line over
-- the bend's own hundred-and-seventy-five -- a visible curve, not a
-- scribble -- and it runs ACROSS the carrier, which is the direction a
-- crest line actually wanders. What it costs is exactness in waveRate's
-- derivation: the carrier's local frequency now breathes around the number
-- the rate is derived from, so the one-pixel step is the average step
-- rather than every step's. The step CLOCK is untouched; only how far a
-- bowed stretch of crest moves on one tick varies, and by under a pixel.
Water.WAVE_BEND = { -0.0138, 0.0333, 0.35, 1.10 }

-- ------- and the beat they move on
--
-- The surface does not slide, it advances in STEPS, off the engine's own
-- frame counter -- the move that makes this read as art rather than as a
-- simulation someone forgot to stylise. A surface built out of whole pixels
-- that crawls between them smoothly gives away that the quantisation is
-- only skin deep.
--
-- 12 a second, a shade under the 15 hand-drawn pixel art is usually
-- animated at: the crests were hurrying, and a big wave is slower than a
-- sprite's walk cycle. Still a clean divisor of the engine's 60, so every
-- step spans the same whole number of frames.
Water.WAVE_FPS = 12

-- How far the dominant train advances each of those steps, in WORLD PIXELS.
-- One is the honest choice for a stepped surface: the whole field shifts by
-- exactly one pixel per frame, so nothing ever lands half-way between two.
-- The rate below is derived from it rather than tuned beside it, so changing
-- a wavelength moves the speed with it instead of quietly desynchronising.
Water.WAVE_PIXELS_PER_STEP = 1

-- Radians of wave phase per second. A train travels `speed / frequency`
-- world pixels per radian of phase, so the phase that moves the dominant one
-- a pixel is its frequency over its speed -- times the step rate.
function Water.waveRate()
  local t = Water.WAVE_TRAINS[1]
  local freq = math.sqrt(t[1] * t[1] + t[2] * t[2])
  local speed = math.abs(t[3])
  if not (freq > 0 and speed > 0) then return 0 end
  return Water.WAVE_PIXELS_PER_STEP * (freq / speed) * Water.WAVE_FPS
end
-- Relief samples down through the slab. With the stride pinned at one world
-- pixel (see WAVE_STRIDE) this is also how FAR the march can see: sixteen
-- samples, sixteen pixels of parallax, which covers the slab at every rung
-- but the very lowest and leaves the rest to fade out honestly.
--
-- The pass early-outs entirely (see relief) whenever the camera is steep
-- enough that the whole slab projects to under a pixel across, which is most
-- of the ladder -- so the cost of this only lands where it buys something.
Water.WAVE_STEPS = 16

-- The furthest one relief sample may travel ACROSS the surface, in world
-- pixels -- which is what bounds how far the march runs in total.
--
-- The march's reach is the slab's depth over the ray's descent, so it grows
-- without limit as the camera flattens: at the top rung, fragments near the
-- horizon look along the water at a few degrees and the reach runs to
-- hundreds of world pixels. Spread over a fixed number of samples that steps
-- clean over whole crests, and the surface comes apart into streaks running
-- away from the eye. Capping the span is what keeps a sample worth taking;
-- what it costs is parallax on the far water, where the columns are under a
-- pixel across and there was nothing left to see anyway.
--
-- This is the FLOOR on it. The stride the march actually takes is a SCREEN
-- pixel's worth of surface, which is the only rate that makes sense:
--
--   up close, a screen pixel is a fraction of a world pixel, so the stride
--   sits on this floor of one world pixel and the march visits every column
--   on its path. It has to: a column is one world pixel wide, a longer
--   stride steps over columns, and which ones it misses changes from
--   fragment to fragment -- neighbouring pixels landing on different columns
--   at different heights wearing different faces. That is peppery noise.
--
--   far away, a screen pixel already spans several world pixels, so a stride
--   that matches it skips columns the screen could not have resolved anyway.
--   Holding it at one world pixel out there does not buy detail, it just
--   runs out of samples -- and a march that runs out stops part-way down the
--   slab and reports the surface as flat, which is why the lowest rung lost
--   its waves entirely across the whole middle distance.
Water.WAVE_STRIDE = 1

-- How far the wave field's own gradient tilts the REFLECTION. A multiplier
-- on the SMOOTH surface's slope, not on the stepped one -- see waveNormal
-- for why that distinction is the whole difference between a moon on the
-- water and confetti. The field's gradient peaks around 0.06 per world
-- pixel, so this lands the steepest faces about twelve degrees off vertical:
-- enough to sweep a low sun or moon into a broken glitter path down the
-- lake, and not so much that the sky's own bands come apart.
Water.WAVE_SLOPE = 3.5
-- and how far the horizon lean is allowed to open that up, since it squashes
-- the same tilt on its way past (see LEAN_FROM)
Water.WAVE_SLOPE_LEAN = 1.5

-- THE MARCH. Steps are in world pixels and lengthen as they go: near the
-- surface the reflection needs precision (a shoreline is a few pixels), far
-- from it reach matters more than accuracy, and a geometric ramp gets both
-- out of one loop. RAY_STEPS is compiled in -- GLSL wants a constant bound.
Water.RAY_STEPS = 24
Water.RAY_REFINE = 5           -- halvings once a crossing is found
Water.RAY_STEP = 3.0           -- world pixels in the first step
-- and the ratio each step after it. 3 x (1.18^24 - 1) / 0.18 is about 930
-- world pixels of reach -- three view-heights, past which a reflection is
-- faded out anyway (see the tail fade in march) and the sky is the honest
-- answer: distant water reflects haze, which is what the bands already are.
Water.RAY_GROW = 1.18
-- How far behind the depth buffer a crossing may land and still count, as a
-- multiple of the depth the step itself covered. A ray that dives far past
-- what it crossed went BEHIND a thin thing rather than hitting it -- the
-- classic screen-space smear, where a tree between the camera and the pond
-- paints itself across the water -- and this is the test that drops it.
Water.RAY_THICK = 1.6
Water.EDGE_FADE = 0.14         -- reflection eased off over this much of the frame

-- ------- the shader
--
-- The scene shader's own vertex path, plus the world position the geometry
-- was actually DRAWN at -- after the world curve, because that is the space
-- the surface the eye MEETS lives in: which wave column a screen pixel is
-- looking at is a question about the geometry as drawn, and relief() answers
-- it there. (The curve only ever moves Y, so a fragment's world XZ is the
-- same on both sides of it and the ripple can be measured off this one too.)
--
-- WHAT IT REFLECTS is worked out on the other side of the bend, in the FLAT
-- world, and this is the same rule the rest of the mode keeps: the curve
-- tips the world away and the things standing on it do not lean with it (see
-- WorldCurve -- buildings stay upright, shadows are resolved before the bend
-- and ride along). A lake is one of those things. Reflect off the bowl the
-- bend has made instead and the far half of a pond is a mirror tilted twenty
-- degrees: it throws the ray past the vertical, where the sky ramp's own
-- measure -- a screen row, through the frame's matrix -- swings from one end
-- of the ramp to the other across a single column, and the pond comes out
-- with hard-edged patches of the wrong sky stamped into it -- the overhead
-- band and the horizon band abutting in the middle of a lake, which reads as
-- something other than water showing through. The same tilt sends the
-- screen-space march grazing along the bank instead of over it, which is the
-- other half: the dock and the roofs smeared across the harbour.
--
-- So the reflection is taken with the flat view ray about the flat normal,
-- exactly as it would be with the curve off -- and the MARCH still has to
-- walk the world as drawn, because that is what the depth buffer holds. Both
-- at once: the ray is straight in the flat world, and project() bends each
-- sample on its way to the screen, which is the same displacement the vertex
-- stage applies and therefore lands in the same place the geometry did.
