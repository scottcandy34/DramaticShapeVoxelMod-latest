-- Voxel world mode: the curved world -- the Animal Crossing horizon.
--
-- Every vertex is pushed DOWN by the square of its horizontal distance from
-- the camera's focus:
--
--     y' = y - k * ((x - cx)^2 + (z - cz)^2)
--
-- and that is the whole effect. The ground you are standing on stays flat
-- (a quadratic is nearly zero near its vertex -- at half a tile out the drop
-- is a hundredth of a pixel), and the falloff accelerates with distance, so
-- the far edge of the map bends away and rolls over a near horizon. The
-- town reads as sitting on top of a small sphere.
--
-- WHAT IT IS NOT is a fisheye. A fisheye is a LENS -- a screen-space
-- warp -- and it bends straight lines everywhere, including right in front
-- of the player, and resamples every pixel to do it. On pixel art that
-- means a blurred, crawling image and a bent HUD. This bends the WORLD
-- instead: one line in the vertex shader, straight lines near the camera
-- stay straight, and not a single pixel is resampled, so the art stays as
-- crisp as it was.
--
-- Two properties are what keep it readable rather than nauseating, and both
-- fall out of displacing along Y only:
--
--   Things stay UPRIGHT. The drop depends on where a column stands, not on
--   how tall it is, so a building's whole column moves together -- the
--   world tips away, the buildings on it do not lean.
--   Shadows and the voxel grid RIDE ALONG. Both are worked out before the
--   bend -- the shadow map in flat world space, the wireframe in model
--   space -- so the bend carries them with it exactly as if it had been
--   painted on. Nothing has to be recomputed and the light frustum never
--   moves.
--
-- The strength is scaled by the VIEW HEIGHT, so a rung looks the same at
-- every zoom: `amount` is the drop, in view-heights, one view-height out.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module
local V = ...

-- The ladder, calibrated against the FAR EDGE of the visible ground -- a
-- little over two view-heights out at the low camera rungs. Since the drop
-- goes as the square, that edge falls `amount * 4` view-heights while the
-- ground within a screen of the player barely moves, which is the whole
-- shape of the effect: flat where you are playing, rolling where you are
-- only looking.
--
-- 1 is a hint of roll at the frame edges, 2 is the Animal Crossing read,
-- 3 is as far as it goes before the horizon closes inside the next block
-- of the town -- which stops being a look and starts being an occlusion
-- bug, since what has rolled away is still there to walk into. (The first
-- cut ran 0.18/0.35/0.60 and every rung of it was a marble.)
--
-- 4 AND 5 ARE PAST THAT LINE ON PURPOSE, and they are for the DIORAMA:
-- once the world is a model being looked at from outside rather than a
-- place being walked around in, "the horizon has closed over the next
-- block" stops being a bug and becomes the entire effect -- the town on
-- top of a little planet.
--
-- 5 is the HALF SPHERE, and it is not eyeballed. The drop is a parabola,
-- y = k d^2 with k = amount / vh, and the parabola that osculates a sphere
-- of radius R at its pole is y = d^2 / 2R -- so k = 1 / 2R, and an amount
-- of 1.0 gives R = vh / 2. The diorama's box is cut at exactly half a view
-- height (Diorama.BOX_FRAC), so at amount 1.0 the model's own rim is that
-- sphere's EQUATOR: the ground turns 45 degrees by the edge of the cut and
-- is falling vertically a view-height out. A dome, ending where the model
-- ends. 4 is the step between it and 3, geometrically rather than
-- arithmetically -- the effect goes as the square of distance, so even
-- steps in `amount` would bunch the whole ladder at the bottom.
