-- STADIUM battles: the two Pokemon as real 3D models.
--
-- The 3D-BTL row's two STADIUM rungs. OFF is the engine's own white battle
-- field; the 2D-3D rungs stand the GB's own pics up as quads
-- (BattleBillboard); STADIUM replaces those quads with the Pokemon Stadium
-- battle models -- skinned, animated, and playing the animation the move
-- being used actually calls for. A or B decides whether that happens on the
-- map or on two discs, and is the same choice on either pair of rungs.
--
-- The models come out of the Stadium ROM through model_extract, and are
-- packed into assets/stadium/NNN.dsm by tools/stadium_pack.py. Nothing here
-- knows about the ROM; the pack is the interface.
--
-- ------- what this file is, and is not
--
-- It is the MODE: which species is out on each side, which animation the
-- fight is asking each of them for, whether the model or the flat pic is
-- standing in this frame, and the two draw calls. The arithmetic is
-- StadiumRig's, the file format is StadiumPack's, and one side's own state
-- is StadiumMon's.
--
-- It is not a rewrite of the staged battle. The arena is picked the same
-- way, the camera is solved the same way, the HUDs and the text box and the
-- move animations and the depth of field are all exactly what 2D-3D draws
-- -- because all of those are hung off the arena's CELLS, not off the
-- pics. Swapping what stands on a cell changes nothing about where the cell
-- projects to. That is why this is an option on the mode rather than a
-- second mode.
--
-- ------- declining, per Pokemon
--
-- Every gate here is per SIDE and per FRAME, not per battle:
--
--   no pack for that species, or its meshes would not build -> that side
--   falls back to its flat pic, and the other side keeps its model
--
--   the side is showing a TRAINER (the foe's class before the send-out,
--   the player's own back before "Go!") -> that is not a Pokemon and there
--   is no model for it; the pic stands, exactly as in 2D-3D
--
--   a SUBSTITUTE is up -> the engine replaces the pic with the mini doll,
--   which is the thing the player is being told is there. A model of the
--   Pokemon behind the doll would be a lie about the battle state.
--
-- So `covers` is asked per side per frame, and OverworldBattle renders a
-- billboard texture for exactly the sides it answers false for.

-- ------- and the collapse gets to finish
--
-- A fainted Pokemon leaves the field when its pic does, which is the end of
-- the engine's slide -- SlideDownFaintedMonPic, seven rows two frames apart,
-- FOURTEEN frames of a 60 Hz clock. Under a quarter of a second.
--
-- The Stadium faint animations are nothing like that short. The briefest in
-- the set is 49 frames of a 30 Hz clock -- a second and two thirds -- the
-- median is 110 and the longest 230, which is nearly eight seconds. Held to
-- the pic's window every one of them was cut off inside its first fifth: the
-- Pokemon began to fall and vanished mid-fall, which is worse than not
-- animating at all, because the eye has been told something is happening and
-- then had it taken away.
--
-- So a model that is COLLAPSING stays until it has finished collapsing, and
-- the two timings stop being tied to each other. That is the whole of the
-- divergence: the slide is how long a flat pic takes to slide off the bottom
-- of a 160x144 frame, and it has nothing to say about how long it takes a
-- Gyarados to fall over.
--
-- Bounded at both ends rather than open-ended. It ends when the animation
-- does (StadiumMon.finished), not when the battle moves on -- so nothing is
-- left lying on the field for the rest of the fight -- and the side is reset
-- outright the moment a different battler stands in that slot (see update),
-- which is what stops the next Pokemon out of the ball arriving face down.

  -- per-battler pic program, `picFx`, and that is where the two-turn moves
  -- live: FLY runs SE_SLIDE_MON_OFF and DIG SE_SLIDE_MON_DOWN on the charge
  -- turn, each a 19-24 frame slide that ENDS by setting `hidden`, and the
  -- release turn puts the pic back through SE_SLIDE_MON_UP /
  -- SE_SHOW_MON_PIC. Every other vanishing act is the same field: the user
  -- of Explosion, a Pokemon that has been Teleported away.
  --
  -- Without this the model simply stood on its tile while the game said it
  -- was underground -- and said it in the strongest way it has, by making

  -- mode's whole method is to let the battle decide and follow it, and a
  -- table of move ids here would be a second place for the same facts to
  -- live and would go stale against a mod that adds a third one.
  --
  -- The engine's slide is 19-24 frames, so the model plays the opening of
  -- its own FLY or DIG animation while the pic slides and is gone when the
  -- pic is. It is NOT held to the end of that animation the way a collapse
  -- is (see below), and the difference is not an oversight: the Stadium
  -- animations are authored as the WHOLE move -- Charizard's DIG is 3.83
  -- seconds of burrow, emerge and hit -- because Stadium plays it in one
  -- turn. Gen 1 splits it across two, so cutting at the engine's own hide
  -- shows the burrowing and holds the strike back for the turn it lands on,
  -- which is the right half of the animation for the turn being played.

-- (BattleState.onFaint's own comment), and the drain takes real frames: a
-- 150 HP mon's bar walks down over some four seconds.
--

-- that was still emptying: the Pokemon lay down, and then its health went on
-- draining above the corpse. What the player reads as the moment of death is
-- the bar hitting zero, and that is what this waits for.

-- RETIRED: its rig is released, which is exactly the state a species with no
-- pack is in, and OverworldBattle renders a billboard for it from the next
