-- STADIUM battles: posing a skeleton and skinning it, on the CPU.
--
-- One instance of this is one Pokemon standing on the map -- the meshes it
-- draws through and the scratch space its pose is computed in. The MODEL
-- (geometry, bones, animations, textures) is shared and read-only; this is
-- everything about it that is per-Pokemon and changes every frame.
--
-- ------- why the CPU
--
-- Because these models are tiny and the mod's shader already exists. A
-- battle model is 674 vertices on average and 1311 at the worst, of which
-- exactly two are on screen at a time -- so skinning them by hand costs
-- about two thousand vertex transforms a frame, which is less than the
-- grass pass does on an empty route. What it buys is that the finished
-- vertices go into Voxel3D's OWN vertex format, through Voxel3D's OWN
-- shader, and therefore get every single thing the rest of the diorama
-- gets for free: the depth buffer decides what is in front of what, the
-- sun pass throws a real shadow of the actual pose, the hour's tint lands
-- on it, the hit flash flattens it, and the tilt-shift and the
-- depth-of-field see it as part of the picture. A GPU skinning path would
-- have needed a second shader that then had to re-implement all of that,
-- and a second shadow shader beside it.
--
-- It is also what makes the FORMAT work. Every vertex in the Stadium set is
-- rigidly bound to ONE bone with weight 1 (model_extract/README.md), so
-- skinning is a single matrix multiply per vertex with no blend -- and the
-- per-vertex `shade` Voxel3D wants, which no glTF has, is computed here
-- from the bone-local normal.
--
-- ------- the two matrix chains
--
-- The game keeps bone scale OUT of the matrix chain (func_800143C0): scale
-- accumulates in its own stack, a bone's local translation is
-- pre-multiplied by its parent's accumulated scale, and a bone's own
-- accumulated scale is applied to the finished matrix only at draw time.
-- glTF cannot express that -- its node scale propagates to children -- and
-- the reference export works around it by splitting every bone into two
-- nodes.
--
-- Here it falls out naturally, as two arrays:
--
--   pivot   rotation and translation only. This is what a CHILD inherits,
--           and it is a pure rotation, which is also why the normals are
--           transformed with it rather than with the draw matrix.
--   draw    the same matrix with the bone's accumulated scale applied on
--           the right, which is the one vertices go through.
--
-- Folding the scale into the chain instead is the obvious mistake and it
-- applies every ancestor's scale once per generation. It is caught by the
-- suite: tools/stadium_pack.py measures the bind pose with this exact walk
-- and its answer matches the verified glTF export on all 151 species.

-- ------- how a surface is lit
--
-- Voxel3D shades a face by its DIRECTION rather than by a light uniform:
-- every terrain and character mesh in this mode carries a per-vertex
-- `shade` baked from which way its face points, and the shadow map
-- multiplies on top of that (see Voxel3D.FACE_SHADE). A skinned model has
-- no fixed faces to bake, so the same answer is computed per vertex from
-- the posed normal -- and these four numbers are FACE_SHADE's own six
-- values, fitted:
--
--     +Y up 1.00   -Y down 0.55   +X east 0.84   -X west 0.72

-- ------- interpolation, and the one place it must not happen
--
-- These streams are not keyframes: they carry ONE VALUE PER FRAME at 30 Hz,
-- and the game steps them a frame at a time. So at 60 Hz the honest replay
-- is each pose held for two frames -- which is exactly what it looks like,
-- a set of models moving at half the frame rate of everything around them.
-- Blending between consecutive entries is therefore not reconstructing
-- something the source had; it is INVENTING the halfway pose. It is worth
-- inventing, because a 30 Hz step against a 60 Hz camera reads as a stutter
-- and the halfway pose is right far more often than it is wrong.
--
-- Where it IS wrong is the reason a naive version of this shipped once and
-- had to be taken out: bones snapping to an upside-down pose for a frame,
-- arms turning inside out for a few. Rotations here are EULER TRIPLES, and
-- a Euler triple is not a direction you can walk along. Two triples can
-- describe nearly the same orientation and be nowhere near each other
-- component by component -- (0, 20976, 32736) and (0, -19936, -5904) are a
-- real pair out of the set -- so walking from one to the other passes
-- through orientations that are nothing like either end. That is precisely
-- a bone flipping over and back inside one frame.
--
-- Shortest-arc wrapping (below) fixes the easy half of that, where a
-- component crosses the +-pi seam. It cannot fix the hard half, where the
-- source simply RE-EXPRESSES a rotation. So the hard half is not fixed, it
-- is DETECTED: a bone whose rotation moves more than BREAK_ANGLE in a
-- single frame is not being animated, it is being re-expressed or snapped,
-- and that bone holds its frame instead of blending. Per bone and all three
-- components together, because the three are one rotation and blending two
-- of them while holding the third is its own wrong answer.
--
-- The same guard, in the same spirit, for TRANSLATION: BREAK_MOVE of the
-- model's own height inside one frame is a teleport rather than a stride.
-- Scale needs none -- a linear blend of two scales lies between them, and
-- there is no way for that to be a pose neither end had.

-- 32768 binary-angle units is pi, so this is a quarter turn in one 30 Hz
-- frame -- 2700 degrees a second. Nothing in the set genuinely moves that
-- fast; everything that reads as moving that fast is a re-expression.

-- ------- keeping the Pokemon on its own tile
--
-- Stadium's animations MOVE the Pokemon, and they move it a long way. Half
-- the set's send-out entrances walk the body more than its own height off
-- the spot it started on; Dewgong's faint travels nearly ten body-heights,
-- and its entrance seven and a half. Every one of them ends exactly where it
-- began, because that game framed each Pokemon with a camera of its OWN that
-- followed the performance around a stage.
--
-- This mode has one camera, solved to put two named map cells at two fixed
-- points in a 160x144 frame (BattleCam), and a Pokemon that travels seven
-- body-heights out of that frame is simply GONE -- which is what sending out
-- a Farfetch'd looked like: an empty tile for three and a half seconds,
-- while its animation played somewhere off to the left of the shot.
--
-- So the bulk travel is taken back out. The pose is measured, and whatever
-- has carried the body further than `limit` from where the bind pose put it
-- is subtracted from every bone.
--
-- ------- why a LIMIT and not an anchor
--
-- Pinning the body outright would flatten the animations into mime: a lunge,
-- a hop, a recoil and a collapse are all the body moving, and they are the
-- part worth having. What breaks the shot is not motion, it is EXCURSION --
-- and the two are told apart by how far. Inside the limit nothing is touched
-- at all, so the 83 species whose animations stay put are bit-for-bit what
-- they were; past it the excess alone is removed, so a big move still reads
-- as big and still comes back to the tile it left.
--
-- ------- where the body IS, and why it is not the median
--
-- The first version of this took the median bone origin, on the reasoning
-- that a handful of bones flung anywhere cannot move a median. True, and it
-- had a worse problem: a median is a RANK, and a rank flips. On a bird most
-- of the skeleton is wing, so as the wings beat, which bone sits at the
-- middle of the sorted list swaps between the up cluster and the down one --
-- and the estimate jumps with it. Measured on Pidgey's standby loop the
-- median moved a tenth of a body-height between adjacent half-frames, and on
-- Pidgeot three whole body-heights. The anchor turns that straight into a
-- translation of the ENTIRE Pokemon, so the body counter-shook against its
-- own wings and the flapping read as twice its real speed. That is the
-- "Pidgey's wings flap super fast" this comment exists because of.
--
-- The centre is now the bone origins averaged, WEIGHTED BY HOW MANY VERTICES
-- EACH BONE MOVES. That fixes both halves at once:
--
--   * the weights are a property of the MESH, computed once and never
--     changing, so there is no rank to flip and no discontinuity available
--     to it -- the estimate is as smooth as the bones themselves
--   * a bone with little geometry on it barely counts, which is exactly the
--     robustness the median was for. Farfetch'd's trail is thirty vertices
--     on five bones -- 1.6% of the model -- so streaking three thousand
--     units out moves this by nothing worth measuring
--
-- Against the median it is two to five times smoother on every species
-- tested and measures the same travel to within a few percent.

-- How far the body estimate may move in ONE 30 Hz frame of a species' own
-- standby loop before that species is judged unmeasurable and left
-- unanchored (see measureBind). The fastest genuine motion in the set is
-- about a fifth of a body-height a frame; the one species that fails this
-- moves three.

  -- ------- and whether this species can be anchored at all
  --
  -- Decided ONCE, per model, offline, by walking its standby loop and asking
  -- how far the body estimate moves between one frame and the next.
  --
  -- Everything the anchor does rests on that estimate being a description of
  -- where the Pokemon is. For 147 species it is: the fastest real motion in
  -- the set moves the body about a fifth of a body-height per 30 Hz frame.
  -- Pidgeot's standby loop moves it THREE, because a few of its rotation
  -- frames are junk (the worst data in the set, and a known issue in its own
  -- right). There is no filter setting that both tracks a real excursion and
  -- rejects that -- measured, at four time constants, either the excursions
  -- came back or the shake did -- because the two are only a factor of
  -- fifteen apart and a filter is a proportion.
  --
  -- So a species whose own idle says its estimate cannot be trusted is not
  -- anchored, and plays exactly as it did before the anchor existed: it
  -- travels as far as its animation says, and it does not vibrate. One
  -- species trading a framing problem for no problem beats 147 trading a
  -- solved framing problem for a shake.
  --

  -- a second anyway.

-- ------- and why the offset is SMOOTHED
--
-- A better centre is not enough on its own. Any estimate that follows the
-- pose carries the pose's own frame-to-frame wobble into it, and the anchor
-- multiplies that up into a translation of the whole Pokemon -- so a species
-- whose source data is erratic (Pidgeot's standby loop has a few frames of
-- junk in it, and no estimator can smooth data that is genuinely wrong)
-- would shake bodily rather than in the one bone that is wrong.
--
-- So the offset is low-passed. What the anchor is FOR is a slow excursion --
-- a Pokemon swimming seven body-heights away over two seconds -- and that
-- survives a filter with this time constant untouched, while anything
-- oscillating frame to frame is flattened. The correction ends up describing
-- where the Pokemon has drifted TO, never how it is shaking on the way.
--
-- HALF_LIFE is in seconds: the time the offset takes to close half of any
-- gap between where it is and where the pose says it should be. Short enough
-- that a real excursion is caught within a few frames of starting, long
-- enough that a 30 Hz wobble does not survive it.
StadiumRig.ANCHOR_HALF_LIFE = 0.05


-- ------- what this does NOT fix, and why it stops here
--
-- The filter is a proportion, so it divides the input wobble down rather than
-- bounding it -- and one species' data is bad enough to get through anyway.
-- Pidgeot's standby loop carries a few frames of junk rotation (the worst in
-- the set, and a known issue since before the anchor existed), which moves
-- the body estimate three body-heights inside a single frame; filtered, that
-- is still about three pixels a frame on a fourteen-pixel model.
--
-- Two further mechanisms were built and MEASURED against the set, and both
-- were taken back out:
--
--   a rate limit on the correction bounded the shake to a third of a pixel,
--   and cost so much tracking that 33 of the 148 entrances went back to
--   leaving the frame -- half the problem the anchor exists to solve
--
--   a rate limit on the MEASUREMENT, to tell a spike from an excursion by
--   speed, could not separate them: the fastest real excursion (Dewgong's
--   entrance, five and a half body-heights a second) is close enough to
--   Pidgeot's sustained junk that any threshold either clipped Dewgong or
--   passed Pidgeot, and freezing on distrust made both worse
--
-- So it stops here, at the setting that is right for the 147 species whose
-- data is not broken. Pidgeot is a data problem and belongs with the other
-- data problems in the CHANGELOG's Known section, not in this control loop:
-- the alternative was distorting every other Pokemon's animation to flatter
-- one whose source frames are wrong.

-- Pull the pose back toward the tile. `limit` is in the Pokemon's own
-- body-heights; nil or a non-positive value leaves the pose exactly as posed.
-- `dt` is the frame's own delta; without one the offset is applied whole,
-- which is what a still (the QA sweep, a probe) wants.

-- ------- which texture each part wears this frame
--
-- The eyes. A primitive whose display list carried geo command 0x23 with a
-- channel index has its texture REPLACED every frame from a stream of
-- texture-table indices (src/18140.c func_800176DC) -- which is how every
-- Pokemon in the game blinks, and how a confused one gets swirls. glTF has
-- no channel for that, so the .glb files carry only the first frame; the
-- pack carries the streams.
--
-- `aux` is an index into model.auxAnims (the stream set) and `frame` its
-- own frame counter, which runs independently of the skeletal one.
-- The eyes, and everything else a material swaps per frame.
--
-- Sampled at the SKELETAL animation's own frame -- the one pose() just
-- resolved -- and CLAMPED past the end of the stream rather than wrapped.
-- Both halves of that matter, and getting either wrong is visible.
--
-- The frame is the skeleton's because in the game a single counter drives
-- both; the data says so plainly, since 507 of the 691 paired animations in
-- the set have a texture animation exactly as long as the skeletal one it
-- rides with.
--
-- The clamp is what the game's own sampler does (func_80017540 indexes the
-- stream and holds the last entry past its end), and it is the whole
-- difference between a blink and a twitch. Rattata's standby loop is forty
-- frames and its blink is FIVE -- `6 8 7 8 6`, open through closed and back.
-- Wrapped on the blink's own length that plays six times a second, which is
-- what it looked like. Clamped, the eye blinks once at the top of the loop
-- and stays open for the remaining thirty-five frames, so it blinks about
-- once a second and a half.
