-- STADIUM battles: reading one species' model off disk.
--
-- `NNN.dsm` holds one Pokemon Stadium battle model. It is written by
-- StadiumBuild, out of the player's own copy of that ROM, the first time the
-- mod runs (see StadiumInstall) -- and by tools/stadium_pack.py, which is the
-- oracle that Lua path is tested against. This file is the other half of that
-- format and nothing else: bytes in, tables out. What the tables MEAN is
-- StadiumRig's business (posing a skeleton) and StadiumMon's (which animation
-- a fight is asking for).
--
-- Three things shape it.
--
-- BINARY, NOT LUA. A species is a couple of hundred kilobytes of numbers,
-- most of it animation, and a Lua source file of that is a parse the loader
-- would pay for on every boot whether a battle happened or not. A byte
-- string is read once, on the frame a fight starts, and only for the two
-- species actually fighting.
--
-- LAZY ANIMATIONS. Geometry, bones and textures are decoded on load --
-- they are small, and every one of them is needed the moment the mon
-- appears. The animations are not: a fight uses idle, an entrance and
-- whichever handful of attacks come up, out of the seven to twenty-one a
-- species carries. So the load pass SCANS the animation block, recording
-- where each one starts and skipping the rest, and a track is decoded the
-- first time something plays it. That turns a 200 KB decode into a 20 KB
-- one plus a few milliseconds spread over the fight.
--
-- AN LRU OF FOUR. A model is shared by everything that draws that species
-- -- both sides of a mirror match, both VR eyes -- and kept for a few
-- battles after, because the next fight on the same route is very often
-- the same Pokemon. Four is enough for a wild fight (two) plus the
-- trainer's next two, and it bounds what the mode can hold to a few
-- megabytes.
--
-- Everything is pcall-guarded and every failure answers nil: a missing
-- pack, a truncated file or a driver that will not make an image all end
-- at the same place, which is the flat 2D-3D card this mode falls back to
-- (see Stadium).

-- DIR is inside the mod, and exists for a developer checkout that has run
-- tools/stadium_pack.py -- which is also how the oracle the Lua extractor is
-- tested against gets built. It is second because a locally built CURRENT
