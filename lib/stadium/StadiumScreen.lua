-- STADIUM battles: the one-time build, on screen.
--
-- A pushed game state, so it draws in the Game Boy's own 160x144 and stops
-- everything under it -- which is what it should do, because it is doing real
-- work and the player should not be walking around while it happens.
--
-- ------- why a species a frame
--
-- A species takes roughly fifty milliseconds to extract, and there are 151 of
-- them. That is ten seconds, which has to go somewhere. Doing them one per
-- frame puts the whole cost on this screen where it is explained, keeps the
-- bar moving at a visible rate, and leaves the frame free to draw between
-- them. Batching more per frame would finish no sooner -- the work is the
-- same -- and would only make the bar jump.
--
-- ------- what it says
--
-- Three things, and each of them is answering a question the player would
-- otherwise have to guess at while the game sits there:
--
--   WHAT is happening -- "STADIUM EXTRACTION", which is what it is.
--
--   HOW FAR through it is -- a bar, filled by species written rather than by
--   elapsed time, so it cannot lie about the remaining work.
--
--   THAT IT IS ALIVE -- which Pokemon it is on, by name. Not decoration: it
--   is the difference between a progress bar the player trusts and one they
--   suspect has hung, and it costs one lookup a frame.
