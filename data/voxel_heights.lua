-- Voxel world mode: the shape PROFILE -- hand-authored pins over the
-- automatic structure detector, the way a 3dSen game profile pins a
-- graphic to a geometry type.
--
-- Hand-authored by this mod, and read only from here: unlike the tables the
-- ROM extractor writes into the player's own cache, nothing below is
-- extracted, derived or copied from the ROM.
-- Nothing here reaches gameplay, collision or scripts; an entry can only
-- ever change how a tile LOOKS in voxel mode.
--
-- Most of the world needs no entry. The runtime detects structures on its
-- own (src/render/voxel/Structures.lua): it flood-fills each connected
-- drawn thing, voxelizes small props per pixel at their real drawn height
-- with transparency (a 2-row plant is a 16px-tall silhouette, not a box),
-- and raises everything else as a volume whose height is measured from the
-- drawing itself -- repeat-aware, so a 6-row house is 48px while a 40-row
-- border forest is rows of 16px trees, not a monolith.
--
-- Listing a tile here BYPASSES that detection: the tile takes the class's
-- height and art mode, always. Use it where the detector reads art wrong,
-- or from a mod to pin its own tiles. Resolution order per tile:
--
--   1. a group listed under tilesets[<id>] below        (this profile)
--   2. the tile sits in a water cell                    -> "water"
--   3. the tile sits in a WALKABLE cell                 -> "ground"
--   4. tile-level fallback: the map's water set -> "water", its walkable
--      list -> "ground", anything left over             -> "wall"
--
-- Rules 2-3 work at CELL granularity (16x16, the walk grid) because that
-- is the granularity collision actually has: the engine judges a cell by
-- its bottom-left tile alone, so the other three tiles of a cell carry no
-- collision meaning -- flowers and grass tufts sit in walkable cells and
-- must stay flat ground even though no walkable list names them.
--
-- Classes (heights in world pixels; a map cell is 16x16):
--   ground / water / void   flat; water recesses so shorelines show a lip
--   ledge / roof / bed      box with the art on its TOP face; partial side
--                           faces crop the art (a 6px ledge face is the
--                           bottom of the lip drawing; a bed is its
--                           mattress drawn from above, lying low)
--   wall / tree / fence / sign / counter / table / desk
--                           box whose SOUTH face folds the 2D artwork
--                           upright, 8px band by band; authored boxes fold
--                           every face and wear their top row's art on top.
--                           A counter is half a cell -- one band, so its

--                           from the drawn staircase
--   stair_down_e / _down_w  a sunken stairwell: the cell opens into a

-- A tileset entry may also carry `prop_ground` (not a class): a map of
-- prop tile id -> ground tile id naming the tile painted under that
-- pinned prop, overriding the flat-neighbour vote -- the cuttable bush
-- stands on the grass Cut leaves behind, whatever borders it.
--
-- And `prop_bg` (not a class either): which GB shades count as BACKGROUND
-- when a pinned per-pixel prop is cut out, for the drawings whose own body
-- reaches the edge of their bounding box and so vote themselves away.
-- Keyed by tile, because two props sharing an atlas can want opposite
-- answers on the same shade.
--
-- And it may carry `figures` (not a class either): hand-drawn pixel masks
-- that lift a FIGURE PAINTED INTO furniture off it and stand it up as a
-- standee, leaving the furniture its own geometry.  A pin resolves a
-- whole 8x8 tile, so it can never separate two things that share one --
-- and nothing automatic can either when the figure has no background
-- margin to flood from and wears the same shades as what it sits on.
-- The Pokemon Center's seated man is the case; see POKECENTER below for
-- the format.  A figure entry that states a `depth` is not a person and
-- stands as a per-pixel SOLID instead of a flat card -- the Marts' cash
-- register, a machine set down on a counter (`thin` gives its top rows a
-- thickness of their own, for the part of a drawing that is paper).
--
-- And `mounted` (not a class either): the same authored-mask escape for a
-- thing painted INTO a WALL band, stood proud of the panel as a thin
-- per-pixel slab instead of standing on its feet as a sprite card.  Where
-- a figure is a person and reads face-on from any angle, a mounted object
-- is an object drawn side-on and holds the wall's own plane; and it keeps
-- its DRAWN elevation, so a thing hung clear of the floor stays hung.
-- The Bike Shop's two wall bicycles are the case -- and the mask there is
-- measured rather than drawn, by flooding the panel tile's own stripe out
-- from behind them; see CLUB below.
--
-- And `wall_top` (not a class either): what a `wall` cell's TOP face
-- wears, whatever the cell itself draws.  An interior wall band is 16px of
-- art folded upright, and a fully folded run has no drawn row left over to
-- lay flat on top -- so the top repeated the FACE, and the town-map poster
-- and the window of a house came out lying across the top of the wall as
-- well as hanging on it.  What is really up there is the wall's own
-- capping course, which is exactly the plain panel the decorated column's
-- neighbours draw.  The face is untouched -- the poster still faces the
-- room.  Two forms:
--
--   wall_top = <id>             every wall in the tileset caps with this,
--                               for an atlas that dresses one kind of room
--                               (the houses, the Centers, Red's floors)
--   wall_top = { [tile] = id }  only the named tiles are redirected, for

        -- (which is what it was) the bell was just ink lying on the
        -- surface -- and lying on it TWICE, because the counter's one top
        -- row had to cover a 16px-deep plot and the mesher repeated it (see
        -- the half-cell rule in ChunkMesher: fixed, and the two stacked
        -- bells were what showed it).
        --
        -- So it is lifted off by mask, exactly like the Marts' till, and
        -- `under` puts plain 8 back -- the counter top the artist drew for
        -- every other cell of the same run, so nothing is synthesized and
        -- the surface closes up seamlessly.
        --
        -- Unlike the till it is NOT an extrusion of its drawing.  Seven
        -- pixels by six of ¾-view dome state a round object and nothing
        -- else usable: every reading that turns six rows into geometry
        -- invents more than it measures.  So the solid is AUTHORED (see
        -- TileShape's `model`) -- a 5x3 puck with its corners taken off,
        -- one voxel proud of the counter, with a single button voxel at
        -- its centre.  `pixels` stays as the segmentation: it is what says
        -- where on the tile the bell is, and the model centres on it.
        --
        -- COLOUR is still not authored.  Each layer names the texel its
        -- faces wear, and all four come off tile 8 -- the counter's own
        -- plain top, whose first rows are one flat shade each: row 0 its
        -- black back edge, row 1 its white highlight, row 5 its light
        -- band.  So the puck's sides are the desk's own light shade, its
        -- top the desk's own white, and the button's sides the desk's own
        -- black, and all four follow every palette bake with it.

      -- interior, used to be left to the volume path here; it is now the
      -- back wall's third band, because a run of four rows has to be

      -- THE CASH REGISTER: a till drawn across two tile rows in the middle
      -- of the counter's east arm, and the same drawing in all nine maps
      -- on this id (eight Marts plus the Indigo Plateau lobby), always at
      -- cell (1,5).  Like the Center's seated man it is drawn INTO the
      -- furniture, so it is cut out by the same authored mask, and for the
      -- same reason: no class pin can separate it from the counter,
      -- because the counter draws its own edging down columns 0 and 15 of
      -- the very same tiles.
      --
      -- That edging is what defeated every automatic reading. Black
      -- always survives the shade flood, so the standee pools extruded
      -- the two rules along with the machine and it stood flanked by a
      -- pair of tall black slabs; `console`'s keep-the-largest-drawing
      -- rule dropped them, but only by throwing away the receipt curl
      -- too whenever the flood happened to cut it loose.  The mask just
      -- says where the machine is: columns 2-13, plus the curl climbing
      -- to the top right, and the counter keeps its edging and its light
      -- work surface.
      --
      -- But it is a MACHINE, not a person, so unlike the seated man it
      -- carries a `depth` and stands as a solid rather than a sprite
      -- card.  A flat card of a till is exactly the billboard the standee
      -- pools exist to avoid -- it read as a decal on the counter, and
      -- turned edge-on with the camera.
      --
      -- AND IT IS NOT A BOX.  The 16x16 packs two facings, and the black
      -- linework says which is which: the keypad has its OWN complete
      -- border (cols 2-8, rows 4-11) sealed inside the outer silhouette,
      -- and what surrounds it is an L --
      --
      --     cols 2-----8 9--12
      --     +-----------+-----+  row 4
      --     |  keypad   | arm |    the L's upright arm: the printer and
      --     +-----------+-----+  row 11    display the paper feeds out of
      --     |   base / drawer  |  rows 12-15: the L's foot, drawn face-on
      --     +------------------+
      --
      -- So the keypad is NOT a face.  It is the machine's DECK seen from
      -- ABOVE -- the keys lie on it -- and `flat` lays it horizontal in
      -- the notch of the L, at the height the base band leaves it and
      -- with drawn row = depth row 1:1.  Extruding it instead stood that
      -- surface on end and painted the keys up the front of a plain box:
      -- the extruded-picture failure, and what the first pass shipped.
      --
      -- Everything else falls out of the drawing: the base band is 4 rows,
      -- so the deck stands 4 above the counter; the arm is 8, so it rises
      -- 8 above the deck; the paper reaches 4 more.
      --
      -- TWO AUTHORED NUMBERS.
      --
      -- `depth` 12, three quarters of the cell.  The keypad's own eight
      -- drawn rows measure 8, and at 8 the machine read thin on the
      -- counter, so the body runs half again deeper and the deck STRETCHES
      -- over it -- 8 rows into 12 voxels, centre-sampled, so every second
      -- row doubles and the keypad still covers the whole surface.  This
      -- is the one place in the model where a texel is not 1:1 with a
      -- drawn pixel; laying the panel 1:1 instead leaves a strip of the
      -- base band's top showing behind the keys.  The model is anchored at
      -- the counter cell's FRONT and grows north into the bare top behind
      -- it, so deepening it can never push the till toward the aisle: at
      -- 12 it still stops 4 voxels short of the cell's north edge.  This
      -- is the number to move if it wants more or less presence.
      --
      -- `thin`: 4 rows at 2.  Row 4 is the machine's
      -- own drawn top edge -- a black rule from column 3 to column 9 -- so
      -- everything above it is the receipt strip, and paper is 2 voxels
      -- like every other `cutout` here.  Centred in the body's band, so
      -- the strip leaves the arm's top face by a slot in the middle of it
      -- rather than flush with its front.  At the body's 8 the curl came
      -- out as a chunky wedge on the corner and stopped reading as paper.
      --
      -- `under` is 16/41 twice -- the plain work surface, which already
      -- carries the west edging (black over white) and the east (dark
      -- over black), so the counter closes up behind the machine with no
      -- synthesis at all.  The `counter` pin on 14/15/30/31 stays: the

      -- 62 the black mullions).  The door panes (41/43, the leaf drawn

      -- Pinned `counter` (8) every counter is the half cell it is drawn

      -- wall cell's front 8px of depth drops with it: a shallow wall

    -- every tile named below really is one of these two maps'.
    --
    -- A statue is built exactly like the badge gyms' (see GYM above):
    -- one cell of FIGURE ($10/$12 over $28/$29) standing on one cell of
    -- PLINTH ($15/$16 the cap over $30/$31 the plaque).  47 of them --

    -- stand the same statue on grass are never placed).
    --
    -- What the detector made of them is the bug this entry exists for.
    -- On the avenue the statues stack with NO gap: the plinth's plaque
    -- row is drawn directly above the next figure's head, so the
    -- flood-fill joined all six of a column into ONE region 24 tile rows
    -- tall, and the volume builder's repeat scan read 32px down one half
    -- of the drawing and 24px down the other.  Each row came out as a
    -- continuous stepped RIDGE of boxes wearing the statue art folded
    -- onto its south face -- probed INDIGO_PLATEAU tiles (16,12)-(17,35)
    -- at 32/24 and (22,12)-(23,35) mirrored.  ROUTE_23's plaza statues
    -- stand alone and fared no better: 24px boxes with the figure's top
    -- row skipped outright.
    --
    -- Pinned the gyms' way the ridge becomes statues.  The plinth is a
    -- SOLID 16px `wall` block; the figure is a per-pixel cutout 5 voxels
    -- deep (the thin `prop` pool) that rides the plinth's top face
    -- through the authored-box support rule and collapses to the
    -- plinth's SINGLE cell of footprint -- Structures' wall-support case,
    -- so the base never marches backwards.
    --
    -- The one thing the gyms did not have to deal with: $28/$29 is
    -- SHARED.  The same bird is drawn again at the foot of every white
    -- pillar, framed there by the pillar's black edge ($25/$26 over that
    -- same $28/$29, blocks $18/$1B) -- 80 of them, 76 down ROUTE_23 and
    -- four on INDIGO_PLATEAU (its two outer corners and the pair
    -- flanking the League's recess).  So $25/$26 joins the same pool:

  -- by lib/Structures.lua) and a north, east or west one is drawn as
  -- NOTHING: the warp sits on the ground cell outside, the art beside it is
  -- plain wall, and top-down that reads fine because you never see the
  -- wall.  In 3D you walk straight into a blank slab.
  --
  -- So the door is put back, on the face the player walks into.  This names
  -- only the ART -- one 16x16 cell of the tileset's own doorway block, rows
  -- north-first, the same ids `frontOnly` above lists as facade-only.
  -- WHERE it goes is not authored at all: lib/Buildings.lua reads it off
  -- the map, from the warps that land in a gate and the building standing
  -- against them (see `sideDoors` there), because the map already states it
  -- and a hand list of thirty-odd coordinates would only be a chance to get
  -- one wrong.

  -- stands against an OVERWORLD building: the Safari Zone's north gate is a
  -- gap between two fence stubs with no drawing to carve, and the Route 22
  -- league gate on ROUTE_23 puts its warps on the road THROUGH the arch

  --              the rest of the drawing is the facade, seen face-on
  --   roofBack   rows laid along the north rim, one row per voxel of depth
  --   roofFront  rows laid along the south rim (the fascia and eave course)
  --   roofCycle  the row run the middle depth cycles; its length must be
  --              the roof texture's period or the courses will not line up
  --   slab       roof thickness in voxels

  --              or nil
  --   seal       sides the drawing runs off rather than closing with its
  --              own outline, as a string of n/s/e/w; the silhouette
  --              flood does not seed there. Only needed by a drawing
  --              trimmed flush to its art -- one whose base course is a
  --              row of brick rather than the black threshold every other
  --              building stands on. Omit it unless the fill says
  --              otherwise: sealing a side the drawing does NOT run off
  --              swallows the terrain beside it.
  --
  -- Nothing here describes the roof's SHAPE, because nothing needs to: the
  -- topmost drawn row of each column is the elevation profile, so a drawn
  -- taper becomes a slope and a roof drawn from straight above comes out
  -- level.  That is why the flat-roofed civic block and its sixteen
  -- relatives -- every Center and Mart, the gyms and gates, the department
  -- store and Silph Co -- share one band table below, differing only in
  -- their tile grids.  The sloped ones fall into three groups just as
  -- cleanly, by the depth of the roof band: 16 rows (Red's house), 32
  -- (Oak's lab) or 64 (the museum).  Before authoring a new one, check
  -- whether its roof band is already pixel for pixel one of those.
  --
  -- assets/docs/buildings/B26 is deliberately absent.  Its drawing has no
  -- black base course -- it ends on a row of light brick -- so the
  -- silhouette flood, which comes in from the border through light pixels,
  -- climbs up through the wall and hollows it out.  Every other building
  -- is sealed by a black threshold row.  Reading it would mean changing
  -- the flood itself, which every model here depends on, for one scenery
  -- placement.
